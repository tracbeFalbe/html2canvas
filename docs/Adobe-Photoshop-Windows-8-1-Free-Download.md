When I purchased Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 I was running it on Windows Vista Home Premium, but have since upgraded to **Windows 10**. I installed Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 on my new laptop and have had nothing but trouble. I was at first able to run the program and access my Catalogue through running the Trouble Shooter and selecting Windows Vista Service Pack 2 (or 3). However, since yesterday I can no longer access my program. If I try to open the Edit and Enhance Photos feature, the program freezes up on launch (where it says reading preferences) and does not open. If I try to open View and Organize Photos, the program also freezes and says that it failed to launch the Catalogue. Several people told me to uninstall the Adobe program from my computer and re-install it. However, after having done so I am still having the same problems. Can you provide me with more assistance? At this time I have uninstalled Adobe from my computer again and am waiting to do a fresh install with some guidance.

I was hoping there might be a work-around to getting the program to work. Strangely, my friend is able to run theirs on Windows 10 without problems. Do you happen to know if I would be able to open my 5.0 projects on the newest version of Adobe Photoshop? I want to be able to access and work on my old projects and hopefully get my Catalogue back. How would I go about doing this?

Open Notepad, paste the code, save as "PSLaunch.bat" instead of a ".txt", and if you want to make life extra easy, redirect your photoshop shortcut to the file. Please note, that this assumes you used the default install directory, if you installed it elsewhere, you will need to change the directory.
 
This code deletes the preferences file which seems to be the issue on Win 10 (and unfortuanately where all the settings are saved, so every launch the settings will be reset) and allows it to properly launch on Windows 10. Kind of a crappy work around but it works every time as of Win 10 20H2
 
I've run it on Windows 10 since Win10 was released, and for the first few years it gave me no issues. However, on more recent updates (19XX/20XX builds), even with a fresh install of windows, it will randomly either work or get hung during launch. The bat file just helps to garentee that PSE5 launches consistantly.
 
Late June of 2022, Photoshop suddenly went cray-cray. The screen was freezing up, showing the opening screen behind my artboard. The whole program would freeze up requiring the good old CTRL+ALT+DEL. When I relaunched Photoshop (PS) I got this error:

Thank you so much for this post. I have had the same problems, both with the graphics and trying to find helpful answers on the forums. When I saw your error screenshot that looked exactly like mine it was such a great feeling. Your fix instructions solved everything for me
 
I have been using photoshop 2023 for a while with no issues. I think I have the standard intel graphics card on windows 10. I opened it today as I usually do and then the same sort of error message came up.  
 OpenCL unavailable

 Insufficient VRAM 0MB of 1500MB

What a mystery. You know, I vaguely remember a message popping up somewhere saying PS was discontinuing 3D features in future releases. Maybe the 3D filters are broken because those features were stripped from the program?
 
I've installed a font that has different styles (bold, italics, thin, medium, ultra and so on...), but I can't use them all because I can't see them in Photoshop. The fonts are installed, but seem in some way "overlapped" by windows.
 
The source of this problem is malformed font files. The internal names of the fonts are in conflict and the flags that indicate connections between the different font files in a typeface family (Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, etc.) are missing.
 
The terminology is awkward. Technically and historically "Foo" is a typeface and "18 pt Foo Bold Condensed" is a font, but in the era of personal computers the definitions have blurred: a typeface is now often referred to as a "font" (even though you'll buy a particular style of that typeface as a "font" in any online store), particularly among non-typographers. The variations tend to be called "styles." People coming newly (last 25 years or so) into design are so used to scaling a font in software that they forget every size of every style of a typeface was once drawn and made individually.
 
For a regular application (non-professional) to give you the usual "Regular, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic" choices, the font files themselves must be individually named internally and the fact that they are associated is a specific internal flag. It's these internal flags that allow you to create bold or italic text with a keyboard shortcut or style dropdown -- the Foo Bold font file tells the OS "I am the Bold version of Foo," and so on.
 
You have a situation where all the individual font files have the same internal name, so Windows can't differentiate them. You see exactly one font (style) in a family; delete it, and you see another one, and so on. In Word, Open Office, etc., that's probably all you'll see. (Arial Narrow famously suffered from this problem because of an error in creating the files -- it just wouldn't show up at all, or would never show up as an available style for Arial.)
 
More sophisticated applications such as Photoshop or InDesign know how to read the association flags in a set of font files and can display all the variations in a single dropdown. Garamond Premier Pro, as an example, has 39 font files in four optical sizes -- caption, regular, subhead and display -- that all show up in a single dropdown if and only if the files themselves contain the correct internal information. The ones you are having trouble with do not.
 
The most common source of the problem you are seeing is conversion utilities that don't do a proper job of taking older or other-platform files and turning them into well-formed OpenType or TrueType files. This often affects (illegal, it must be said) Mac --> Windows conversions, because on Mac OS the font information is split between a visible file and a hidden one. If the conversion utility doesn't correctly parse the hidden file, you get a malformed OpenType or TrueType font file that won't work properly on either platform.
 
For me in Windows, Adobe has always had a missing fonts problem: fonts installed are not listed. The solution is to put copies OR SHORTCUTS of the fonts that are missing into the adobe common fonts folder. On my 64-bit machine the default location is:
 
I created a shortcut to my system fonts folder in the above listed folder, and all the previously unlisted fonts are now shown in adobe programs. Using a shortcut ensures that any fonts I add later are automatically scanned by adobe programs upon startup.
 
Note also that it is typical behavior of well-designed typeface families that if you have a Foobar Sans Bold, it will be automatically selected when you choose "bold" from a type menu (provided the software supports the hinting). In other cases, there will be a dropdown where you can pick the specific special font (regular, bold, italic, smallcaps)
