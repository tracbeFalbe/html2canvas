If you do have a third party anti-virus go into settings and then look for something like anti-ransomware or folder protection. Have a look at the blocked apps list, if you see **soffice.bin** in there change it to Allowed (you might have to read AV help if not obvious). Otherwise go to the Allowed Apps setting and allow **soffice.bin**, this might not be easy so you might have to change the file type to **All** to see it and to add the Allowed list. Or you might have to start entering **Soffice.bin** before you can select it in the navigation dialog
 
EarnestAI, I explored your suggestion with Avast, my anti-ransomware supplier. If the anti-ransomware was involved, it would have sent me an alert indicating that access to these files was being blocked. Since I never received such an alert, their product was not the cause of these files being lost. Someone suggested that the Toshiba external hard drive where I was storing the files may have become corrupt. Do you think this is a viable cause of the problem? If so, is there a way to recover the files that were deleted?
 
It is worth making sure that soffice.bin is on the list of allowed programs for Avast. The method of file locking it uses seems to involve changing permissions on the files. This can mean the anti ransomware program on one computer can allow access to a shared drive, but if that computer is turned off, another computer with the same user, or the same computer with another user, cannot access those files. To be honest, when I found out I was getting blocked on different computers on my network, I removed all anti-ransomware protection and then all third party anti-virus and now rely on Defender (which uses a different method of blocking access) and caution.
 
ATP is included in Office 365 Enterprise E5, Office 365 Education A5, and Microsoft 365 Business. If your organization has an Office 365 subscription that does not include Office 365 ATP, you can potentially purchase ATP as an add-on.
 
I try a trial in my lab, and when get this add-on, it will display in the user license page, and it would need to enable this license for the user, then configure the policy and assign the policy to the users.
 
In my understanding, the ATP could be used to scan safe link and attachment as an add-on while EOP works for spam, viruses and malware in mail flow. Only the attachments that pass EOP anti-malware scanning are impacted by the ATP safe link or safe attachment policies.
 
The announcement was made back in August and they suggested it would take until Oct to deploy. It is unclear what the exact anti-spoofing tech is, but it will dump spoofed emails into the junk folder by default and you will be able to configure this by policy.
 
Lowering the phish threshold by using Exchange transport rules EOP provides a number of protections against phishing messages including the use of first and third party reputation data, heuristic clustering and machine learning. Within ATP an additional set of machine models are used to further analyze messages for phishing and these models can be controlled through an ETR. Machine models return a score based on the probability of a message being phish. Based on this score certain actions are taken. At a higher score stronger actions are taken than at lower scores, however for certain users in the organization you may want to take stronger actions on the message even if the score is lower. To achieve this you can use a transport rule to set a threshold for where the strongest action is taken. Since the scoring is non-linear we recommend setting this to a value of 2 (medium).
