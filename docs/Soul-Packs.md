I haven't been able to upgrade my aura for over 1/2 a year because it's stupidly expensive to upgrade and there is no viable way to farm pet pods/packs. Please either drastically reduce the price or make a way to farm them. Do not give me solo dungeons as an answer to farm them because I have over 100 clears on hong and mao and have only seen 2. Stuck on pre unleashed ultimate, because I need over 100 just for a couple of stages and prices are 85ish gold. 8.5k Just to upgrade old content gear, pretty sad.
 
If one does it this way to get pet packs, it's a matter of whether you can withstand the torture of losing most of the time due to classes CC'ing you non-stop, while slowly burst-firing you down with moderately-high DPS or not.
 
But even then, there's still the "farming" aspect with PvP that's frustrating when given a horribly-balanced PvP system. If I'm reluctant to PvP despite me knowing that it'll help my character and alts. progress through the gear system, that's a sign that there's something wrong with PvP in Blade & Soul; I shouldn't have to feel that way, but I do because I know that there are some classes in this game that are broken for the reasons I described earlier.
 
Incorporating abilities on classes that stun players is not an issue, but it becomes one if players could combo to stunlock players in their tracks and prevent them from doing anything, especially when the abilities used for recovery are few to none, and there's no way to escape at that point. What I said in this quote highlights my frustration with doing PvP, and it's not worth my time nor stress to endure it just so I could get "a little bit ahead" when I could be getting very far ahead farming Moon Refuge, CS, HM, and raids non-stop.
 
2) Even if you have max pet, if you are careless, you still die or lose a lot of DPS. High HP and Def are cool, but Pet won't help you face tank every single attack. Some attacks even deal fixed damage that ignore def. Meanwhile, a no pet person can survive just fine if they are careful to not get hit.
 
4) You can have extra HP from unity system, which boosts your HP by a nice amount. Also talisman, though I don't advise upgrade it past the stage where it starts to ask for pet pack. And you can always have exyra HP from 20 HM points to defense, if you are desperate.

Thanks for the advice. I might instead focus upgrading my accessories and weapons, since I know those matter, and I still need to advance my Legendaries by a few more levels to gain the extra AP and crit. I need to improve my DPS.

Spectral Cards are similar to Tarot Cards in the sense that they generally modify the playing cards in the deck as well, though to a much greater extent than Tarot Cards. In exchange for these large modifications, they usually disadvantage the player in another aspect of gameplay, such as reducing hand size, destroying additional cards or consuming all money. There are 18 different cards with no unlock conditions, but they can usually only be found in booster packs and not individually. It is possible to spawn Spectral Cards via certain Jokers, or, in certain circumstances, purchase them in the shop, in which case they will take up a Consumable slot.
 
The chance of each Spectral card appearing is equal, except for The Soul and Black Hole. These two can only be found in Booster Packs, with the Spectral and Arcana packs being able to contain The Soul, and Spectral and Celestial packs being able to contain Black Hole. Both have a 0.3% chance to appear for every card found in one of their respective Booster Packs. These are also the only 2 Spectral cards that cannot be created by Sixth Sense and Sance, or found in the shop when using the Ghost Deck.

Sample packs are versatile and creative tools that give producers quick access to a wide range of high-quality sounds. They facilitate the music production process and offer an efficient way to experiment and explore new ideas in music.

Sample packages have different copyright policies. Some may require attribution or have restrictions for commercial use. It is important to review the specific terms of use for each package before using them in commercial projects.
 
After purchasing a sample pack, you access the download from your account on the purchase website or through the automatic download link.

A red, green, or black deck is automatically available at the start of the game. Opponents are arranged in "tiers", which are unlocked by defeating each opponent in the previous tier a certain number of times. Except for Tier 5, which has 4 duelists, each tier consists of 5 duelists.
 
There are 819 different cards in total. Cards are accessed from the Deck Edit menu and are stored in the Trunk (which can hold more than 10,000 cards). They can be transferred to the Main Deck or Side Deck. The Main Deck must contain 40-60 cards, but also allows up to an additional 20 cards in the Fusion Deck section. The Side Deck can hold up to 15 cards, which becomes available between certain special event duels, such as Weekend Duels.
 
An important aspect of the game is the in-game calendar. On certain days of the week, random events may occur, such as receiving a pack of cards in the mail or being challenged to a Match by an opponent. The calendar advances one day after each duel.
 
*The Eternal Duelist Soul* is nearly identical to *Stairway to the Destined Duel*, except there are fewer cards to choose from and the default animation speed is slower, though there is the option of holding the R button before the duel starts to permanently speed up that particular duel. It is also the first game to include Polymerization as an actual card.
 
While the Duel Computer claims that it is building a deck to counter yours, it uses the same deck every time you face it. Its strategy revolves around effects that hinder the opponent's strategy, which creates the illusion of the game deliberately countering the player's deck.
 
Pegasus is programmed to be able to see the player's hand and face-down cards. However, due to the game's limited AI, it has little impact on the game and is barely noticeable. Pegasus will not attack a face-down defense position monster that he cannot destroy, but he will not change his strategy in any other way.
 
There are 819 cards in total. The game follows the May 2002 Lists, which did not include Forbidden cards. Booster Packs can be obtained by advancing through 5 tiers of duelists. Some packs can only be unlocked after defeating an opponent a certain number of times.
 
Cards are kept in a Trunk where they can be accessed through the Deck Edit section of the Main Menu screen and may be placed in the Main Deck or Side Deck. Fusion cards can be added to the Main Deck and do not go towards the 40 card minimum.
