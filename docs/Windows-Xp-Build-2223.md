**Windows XP build 2223 (main)** is a build of Windows XP that was shared online on 17 April 2000.[1] It is the last build to include the HAL for the SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540 (HALBORG.DLL), the Imaging program, support for the 486 processor and the ability to upgrade from Windows 95. It is the earliest leaked build to update the kernel version to 5.1.

The ability to quick format on partitions has been added. The EULA has also been updated to include the Whistler codename. While the Setup is copying files, the text specifying so has had it's Windows 2000 reference removed.
 
The Upgrade Device Driver wizard has been updated and renamed to the Hardware Update wizard. Installing a driver from a CD or floppy disk is now done automatically, as inserting said media will now cause the wizard to install the best said driver from the media. However, aside from some rearrangements and text rewords, not much has changed from the previous app.
 
Some changes were done to the user interface, incorporating more Whistler references and changes. The build itself now identifies itself as "Whistler 2001" in the start menu and login screensaver, the taskbar also received a slight update while applications are active and inactive, with the box surrounding the application no longer appearing when inactive. The Start menu option "Shut Down" was also renamed to "Turn Off Computer".

This build updates the Neptune-style login screen, with it now being the default login screen. This includes several updates, like the Windows logo present in the middle of the login screen being replaced with four circles colored after the Windows logo, the computer name being moved to the blue sidebar and the "Click on your name to start" text being renamed to "Click on your user account to log on". Instead of a shell being used as the default user account profile, a user is used instead.
 
The "Web" section of the Display applet has been moved as an option in the "Background" section instead. This however, removes the ability to have a pattern on the desktop. The "My Pictures Slideshow" option was added to the Screen Saver options, now allowing for a slideshow to be used as a screen saver.
 
Some changes have been done to the Sound applet. A new "Voice" section was added, used for microphone's and other audio devices. The Sound Volume option was also removed from the applet itself. In Folder Options, the option to Display the simple treeview in Explorer's Folders list and the option to show My Network Places on the desktop was added.
 
A new "Scanners and Cameras" folder has been introduced, now allowing for multiple scanners and cameras to be connected easier. The old applet however, remains and is still accesible. User Profiles were moved to the Advanced section in the System applet, with a new Remote applet taking it's place, allowing for other users to be able to use Remote Desktop to connect to the current computer.
 
This is the first build to include parts of the visual style engine as well as an early version of the Business theme (Business.thx). Adrian of the Airesoft blog released a working UXtheme file to allow the theme to be enabled.[2]
 
The theme, when enabled, changes the design of all windows to include a blue border with lighter gray shades. The theme was meant to engage in a more user-friendly experience for home users. It is buggy; the theme can often cut out parts of the window and some features such as displaying menus don't work or cause instability. Registry entries (located in HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ThemeManager) modify how the theme works:
 
The initial theme file contains comments regarding to changing the color of the theme. If these comments are uncommented, the theme will utilize color based on a themes.inc settings file. The file will be read as .ini format, similar to other builds onwards.
 
The new sound setting applet that would be used in later builds as well as the final RTM build of Windows XP is included in this build, however there is no way to have this applet normally open. Adrian has provided an executable that allows this applet to open. It contains sound options like the volume and speaker settings or speaker configurations.
 
This is the first build to include the ClearType font rendering feature. If the FontSmoothingType DWORD value is set to 2 in HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Control Panel\Desktop, the user will be able to enable the ClearType font rendering upon reloading Windows Explorer. ClearType font rendering wouldn't be enabled by default until Lab06 compile of build 4029 of Longhorn.
 
An out-of-the-box experience was ported from a Windows Me build here. Much like in the Windows Me builds, it can be run by executing C:\WINNT\System32\oobe\msoobe.exe /f. There is no way to get past the product key entry portion of the OOBE, but it can be skipped via the debug skip button. After the OOBE is completed, it will restart and will not exit properly after the user presses Finish on the final screen, forcing the user to terminate the process. Merlin does not function and pressing him or pressing F1 on the keyboard does nothing.
 
There is code in shell32.dll to allow a Start Page to load, which was present in Neptune and some Windows Me builds. It requires registry modification and a patched webvw.dll in order to work. You can perform the required registry modification by going to HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer and setting ShellState so the last 4 zeros read 02 00 00 00. After that, you have to enable Active Desktop and log off. However, it will not work without the patched webvw.dll.
 
This build is the first to include Terminal Services in the base OS, and along with it Fast User Switching was introduced. To enable it, go to HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon in the registry and set AllowMultipleTSSessions to 1. Logging off after doing this breaks the login screen, and a restart is needed to recover from this.
 
The functionality of automatically hiding tray icons when not in use is present, but there is no interface to use it. It can be enabled by going to HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer and creating a DWORD value named EnableAutoTray and setting it to 1. Once enabled, the "Enable Personalized Notifications" checkmark will appear in the system tray properties. The icons will collapse to an exclamation mark every 15 minutes. This design would be changed to an arrow in the next available build.
 
This build contains basic functionality for CD Burning, one of which is the Web View. To see the web view create a new folder, open it, then right click on an empty space and select Customize this folder. Select any of the templates and it will create a desktop.ini file. Open the desktop.ini file and change PersistMoniker to point to file://C:\WINNT\Web\cdburn.htt.
 
On some machines, the installation may bugcheck with the error code DRIVER\_IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL while copying setup files. This is caused by HIDCLASS.SYS - removing every USB accessory except the keyboard fixes this.
 
Like many late builds of Windows 2000 and Windows Neptune build 5111, this build also contains a race condition in the IDE driver. The bug primarily manifests on newer machines with the device rebooting during the installing components in the second phase of setup as IRQ requests are made towards the IDE controller too quickly, reverting all changes made in the second phase of setup entirely. The bug may be prevented by rapidly issuing mouse and keyboard input requests or by utilizing a machine emulator such as 86Box, allowing enough time for processing.
 
The bug can be worked around in VirtualBox by using the VBoxManage utility to enable an artificial delay when processing IRQ requests in the IDE controller. This can be done by issuing the following command:
 
ERROR: [Labtools 27-2223] Unable to connect to hw\_server with URL "TCP:localhost:3121".
Resolution: 1. Check the host name, port number and network connectivity.
2. Check to ensure the hw\_server is running on the target.

I tried all of this again disabling my firewall. All of this seems to point towards Windows blocking access to sockets with low port numbers. If I run the hw server manually with the following (rebasing all the default ports to the 50000 range) I get no warnings on the server side: hw\_server.exe -s tcp::50121 -g50042 -p50000
 
@JColvin @attila Thank you everyone for your help! It turned out that Windows Hyper-V was excluded the port ranges needed for Vivado. I disabled Hyper-V and now I am able to connect to the device. I don't know if there is a way to tune Hyper-V to relax the port restrictions. Either way you may want to post some sort of notice for others who may encounter this issue in the future.
 
@attila Thank you for that suggestion. There are no rules set in my Firewall and I was never prompted by the Windows Firewall. I believe that is because I use Norton Security. I've disabled Norton to eliminate that as a possibility.
 
@JColvin Yes, I just installed the newer version of Digilent Adept and when I run it I am able to find the device. I never tried to run an earlier versio
