Often, I start a project with sanding using my DeWalt Orbital Sander. It really gives me an opportunity to give the piece a good once over. I physically touch every part of the piece, checking for needed repairs as I go.

The shelving supports that are in the back of this vintage kitchen cupboard were coming apart because they were warped as well. Wood screws, wood glue, and clamps solve this problem too! Let me show you how!
 
I like to label mine to prevent any flecks of an undesirable color on a piece. For instance, if there were any leftover bits of black paint in this brush, it would have been a disaster on the light Ironstone paint!
 
When the whole piece was painted the two coats of MMS Ironstone Milk Paint, I used a sanding block wrapped in 220 grit and gently went over the whole piece. (A 200-grit sanding block would work as well!)Doing this will smooth the surface of the milk paint and prep it for the clear coat.
 
Our client wanted the backboard as close to the original as possible so we chose Miss Mustard Seed Milk Paint in Tricycle. It is a gorgeous red and is very reminiscent of the red that would have been popular back in the hay day of this vintage kitchen cupboard. You see the final look in my next post!
 
First things first, before you strip the laminate from your kitchen cupboards, you need to know what they are made of. The laminate was already peeling away from some of my cupboard doors before I began, so I could see they were MDF doors. My kitchen is a bog standard IKEA carcass with particleboard frames and MDF doors. Only the doors have laminate on them.

I chose not to remove the trim around the top of my cabinets. It just felt like a disaster waiting to happen as the screws looked ancient! As the laminate was glued on underneath where the trim attached to the top of the cabinets, I used a stanley knife to score along the edge and then peel the laminate off. I then caulked along the edge to hide the cut and join for a seamless finish (see caulking below in the prep section).
 
I spent hours choosing the perfect colours for our kitchen and painting it was like the reward for the prep work. Before you go full steam ahead, the doors will need a bit or prepping and possibly some repair work.
 
I would suggest either an eggshell, satin or gloss finish for the kitchen. Eggshell has the lowest sheen and gloss the highest. Matt paint is not really suitable for a kitchen. It will soon get very grubby and is difficult to clean. If you do use a matt paint (and I advise that you do not) then a finishing wax (such as beeswax) will improve durability and make it easier to clean.
 
The paint will take about a month (yes, a month!) to fully cure. It might feel a bit sticky in this time during this time. Curing is basically hardening up, so you should take care not to be too boisterous with your cupboards during this time. Think of them like a soft shell crab!
 
Goodness Gracious Kitchen & Cupboard, was born in 2010. A faraway dream tucked away for the right time, place, and pertinacity. Carmel, Indiana is my fairytale end and now the beginning to a new legacy. All of my loves, in one place, to share with you. We focus on creating an experience of comfort, nostalgia, and connection from the most genuine place.
Preserving the past with food and tradition... simply means our food is crafted from old recipes, old stories, old memories. We bring new life to forgotten traditions. We get out our good dishes year-round to reminisce the precious moments in life. We represent the heart of many homes, from our kitchen to your table. We aim to please with every detail, doilie, and dish in our own way....We put a bow on it!
 
We all wish we had walk-in pantries and butler pantries like you see on those fabulous make-over shows, alas it is just not reality for me so here is how I make myself smile every time I open the kitchen cupboard pantry.
 
My pantry cupboard has been a mess since forever, a dumping ground, really. I blamed the spices because they were in different sized jars and containers and kept falling over, ugh. Also things got lost like in the Bermuda Triangle in there.
 
4. **Label** everything as evidently you will not remember what it is what or mix them up with similar looking ingredients like curry and turmeric. ( yep that happened to me) I used some washi tape and a black marker but I might be looking for a label maker soon. Also I cut out the expiration dates of the packets and toss them in the container.
 
Many a jar has crashed on the floor in 1000 pieces when trying to reach for something. Now the baskets are easy to remove and locate what I need. I have a basket with nuts and dried fruit, one for the seeds, cereals, crackers and cookies and on the shelve above for the cans, honeys and sugars.
 
Today I was able to get through the worst cupboard in the entire kitchen. For me, that is my Tupperware/miscellaneous container cupboard. Oh my gosh, it drives me nuts and it is impossible to keep it organized for long.
 
After I sorted through and kept what I wanted to, I started making sure that everything had matching lids. To my absolute surprise, every single container had a matching lid. You could have fooled me with how long it takes to find one every day!
 
One of them I filled with a few things that I use less often and pushed it to the very back of the cupboard. The other I filled with lids and labeled it, in the hopes that the people living here will actually put the lids away there.
 
These adorable ice cream dishes were stuffed way in the back and were always rolling around being annoying. I moved them over to the hutch where I had made room for them when I decluttered all the games. I am much happier having them over there.
 
Finally, I just organized what was left as best as I could. Plastic/Tupperware containers are not super easy to organize. I realize that I will need to re-organize this cupboard often in order to keep it working properly.
 
I don't know if you buy ice cream in plastic boxes - I used to, the boxes they came in were about 6 inches long by about 4 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. I kept those - each one is filled with spices and herbs, and I stack one on top of another, on top of the caps on the jars in the one below. It does mean you have to lift off the top box to get whatever you need in the one housed below, but that's a lot easier than moving several individual jars of herbs balanced on one another. Any suitable box from any product you buy could be used, I just happened to have lots of ice cream containers. You may decide you need prettier boxes though, if they're on display, mine are inside a cupboard, but really, herbs and spices should be kept in the dark, in a closed cupboard, not permanently exposed to daylight, unless the containers aren't clear.
 
Get it out of your cupboard and onto your refrigerator. My fiance had bought me a pre-made set of magnetic spice holders and they are great; took a great deal of my spcies out of my cabinet and they are now on the fridge. Here is how you can make your own.
 
I searched the web in an effort to find some similar pieces that you could use to recreate this look. Like most of my vignettes, most of these pieces are indeed vintage and I can not always find the same exact pieces that I use. But, I did manage to find a few today! If you are interested in recreating this look then feel free to click on any of the images below to learn more about each piece.
 
I really do like how this space all came together and I hope that this little vintage patriotic kitchen cupboard inspires you to jump right over to your very own kitchen cupboard to add in a few patriotic colors!

I love those vintage tins especially the statue of Liberty one it is very cool, I have not seen one like it before which make it super unique in my book! As a vintage hunter like yourself I know what a treasure it must be!
 
Cornell University alum Aiden Payne started working for the Dryden Kitchen Cupboard when she was a home economics teacher for Dryden Central School District, later becoming one of the coordinators for the cupboard after retiring from her teaching position.
 
One of the more recent projects the Kitchen undertook was its annual Thanksgiving baskets. Typically, kids from surrounding youth groups and schools would help pack baskets for area families for Thanksgiving dinner, but this year, that format had to change.
 
As Payne described, despite any challenges staff faced, there was no question that the Dryden Kitchen Cupboard had to find ways to keep providing its services. And that approach will continue well into 2021.
 
If you want to donate fresh produce, bread, eggs, anything that needs refrigeration or a large amount of food, please make arrangements with Kitchen Cupboard staff ahead of time. If you want to make a financial contribution, checks and cash can be sent to Dryden Kitchen Cupboard c/o Dryden Presbyterian Church, PO Box 42, Dryden, NY 13053.
 
Though, this is not my job as my wife does it well; but still I guess my expectations are high. I always find some mistakes and in the end, I get into the organizing thing into the kitchen. The above suggestions are well said and useful. Not all, but will implement some!
 
I just cleaned my cupboards and added some Interdes
