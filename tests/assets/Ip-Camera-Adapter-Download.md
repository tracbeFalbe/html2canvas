Most models of iPad require a Power Adapter rated at 12W or greater to reliably charge. 5W Power Adapters intended for older models of iPhone are inadequate to charge an iPad; if the iPad charges at all, charging will be very slow.
 
Be aware that many computer USB ports cannot source sufficient power to charge an iPad. Unless explicitly designed for charging connected devices, computer USB ports are typically limited to 0.5-1A @5V (i.e., 2.5-5.0W).

If you continue to experience difficulties when using an appropriate Power Adapter of 12W or greater, you might be best advised to seek assistance directly from from Apple Support - and request a remote diagnostic test. You can contact the Support Team using this link:
 
Alternatively and perhaps easier, you can initiate and manage your support cases using the excellent Apple Support App. If not already installed on your iPad, the App can be downloaded from the App Store:
 
You might also visit the Genius Bar at your local Apple Store or Apple Authorised Service Provider (AASP) - where the technicians will be able to test and assess your iPad, Power Adapter and cable(s):
 
iPhone 13 Pro Max here hitting same issue. I've been using the official Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter for months to send lossless Apple Music to my DAC, and it's worked flawlessly and charged my phone at the same time.
 
As soon as I updated to iOS 16.5 this morning, the adapter not only doesn't communicate to the DAC at all, it doesn't even charge my phone. When I test plugging in an iPad on a previous OS version, it communicates and charges just fine.
 
It is definitely 16.5 update issue. After update my daughter's iPad 6gen cannot be charged anymore through camera adapter, so my daughter is not able to use her midi keyboard with her iPad anymore (as iPad is not charging she get's message ther is not enough power) . Luckily there is an old iphone 6s in the house that was off, so it did not update to 16.5 automatically, and adapter works just fine with it, it still charges and connects with midi keyboard, everything works just fine with the same adapter. I almost bought a new adapter thinking it is the adapter's fault, but obviously it isn't. I would be very nice from Apple guy's to fix this 16.5 issue.

The Apple Support Community is a user-to-user technical forum. Other than the site Moderators, Apple neither monitor nor participate within the Support Community. Contributors here are all end-users, just like you.
 
That's a question I can answer. This is a user-to-user technical support forum. Apple's primary role is to make sure everyone adheres to the Terms of Use. It's a huge job and doesn't leave them time for reading the forum for suggestions of feedback. There are some Apple employees, the Community Specialists, who do answer questions in certain forums which have gone unanswered for more than 12 hours and can be answered primarily with a link to a support article.
 
If you want Apple to know your thoughts on this matter, this is not the place to ask them. You can use the Support link at the bottom left of every page to read out to them directly. You can also leave feedback on the dedicated Feedback page:
 
As is, with iPadOS 16.5, the Apple USB3 Camera Adapter will allow pass-through charging when using a USB-C Power Adapter - but not when using a USB Type-A Power Adapter, regardless of power output (W). The current issue exists with both iPad and iPhone.
 
For iPad models with a Home button, do a simple hard reset/forced restart of your iPad by holding down both the Home and sleep/wake/power button simultaneously until your iPad goes to black and restarts with Apple logo, then release the buttons.
 
The Basic Camera Adapter (1.25") accepts an eyepiece that will project an enlarged image to the camera or imager such as a Meade DSI. A 1.25" eyepiece is typically inserted into the body of the Basic Camera Adapter, typically in the 15mm to 32mm focal length range. The resulting effective focal ratio is then determined by the eyepiece and telescope used.
 
For DSLR type cameras a T-ring is additionally required, ordered separately for your camera brand. The Basic Camera Adapter permits a rigid coupling of the camera to any telescope with a 1.25" eyepiece holder. The T-mount threads onto the universal threads of the T-Adapter on one side and has the bayonet-mount unique to the user's brand of DSLR on the other side. In this way the camera body is rigidly coupled to the telescope's optical system, which in effect becomes the camera's lens.
 
Meade Instruments is acknowledged as one of the most innovative and dynamic companies in the telescope market. Known for its groundbreaking telescopic designs, Meade has introduced dozens of improvements over...
 
A huge benefit of the Apple version is the addition of a charging port on the adapter which has saved me many times. A lot of great devices are bus powered but the iPad won't supply enough charge for them to light up. Input the Apple charger into the bus port and all is well.
 
The cheaper adapters (I looked into) don't have this extra lightning port... if that $15 one does I'd probably check it out rather than spending $40 to just have a spare. Apple does have a valid reason to make these cheap products fail: they CAN and often do cause hardware failures in iPads, iPhone, etc. Esp, cheap rechargers that cause Apple's battery to overheat. Pay the Apple tax and you'll probably get stuff that works as advertised and when it doesn't they usually replace it with enough discrete pressure at their stores, in my experience.
 
I do however love cheap stuff that also just works and can be hacked: like the Raspberry Pi,  
Linux on Intel. But the fun is in learning how to make cheap stuff work. The benefit is re-gifting cheap stuff to people without money.
 
Note that even with the charger attached, you will probably need a powered hub for plugging in multiple devices. I tried my iRig HD2 and a USB MIDI keyboard with a trusty passive USB hub and both devices together only worked correctly when the hub had power.
 
I have the standard apple kit, and use a Novation 2x4 soundcard - it has 3x powered usb ports for all my controllers and it works great! Only thing that could make it better is a preamp on an audio in for regular mics... oh and to be able to select which of the 2 stereo outs ApeMatrix uses (other apps see both sets of outs just fine)...
 
Usb3 dongle thing only charges ipad, not external stuff hooked to usb. However since it reduces just a tiny bit power needed by ipad itself(due to being charged), it can help to supply enough power to some gear that would need a powered hub. That is just for gear that almost get enugh power, but not quite. Something like audio interfaces and most of stuff you would hook require powered hub
 
Works for me. I have a good sized Anker power bank and got a USB-A to barrel connector for a couple of 5v powered USB hubs I have. This lets me charge the iDevice and power the USB hub and devices. I run the Lightning power cable to another USB port on the bank, not the USB hub.
 
If I bought the Apple Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter for my iPhone 7 Plus, would I be able to use use the Lightning to headphone jack adapter in the female lightning slot, a midi keyboard in the USB slot, and then plug the male lightning end into my phone and have everything work?
 
Not sure but I think the lightning side is only for charge... but try! Maybe I'm wrong since the lightning is digital (has a dedicated ic managing the pins) and plugging the headphone adapter makes the magic happens
 
If the lightning side is just for charging, and is currently charging, will the USB side still need a powered hub, or will a passive hub be sufficient since it is getting power from the lightning side?
 
I plugged the mini headphone adapter into the USB adapter going into my iPhone 7plus and my phone announced that "This accessory is not supported by this device." The USB adapter works with a portable keyboard (didn't test it with my full 88 key keyboard) and I use Bluetooth speakers to pair with the phone.
 
The lightening port on the cck3 is for charging only. Pretty much everything else gives the error "accessory not supported". An alternative however..... Is use a usb hub and connect a keyboard and USB interface. Or. Use a Bluetooth keyboard.
 
Actually it does power the hub. It's how I connect my launchpad pro and my 2 k-boards. The launchpad pro does not power on without a power adapter or battery bank connected to the cck3's lightening port. It gives the error "device needs too much power" otherwise.
 
From my testing it seems the USB port only gives around 500ma. Luckily for me the launchpad pro seems to consume at max around 400ma. That leaves enough juice for a launch control Xl or 2 k-boards. Any more simultaneous devices and I still need a powered hub. It can say power the novation audiohub even without a power supply attached to the interface. But will not power anything alongside it. Still useful for doing unamped field recordings though. And I got m cck3 at launch. So highly doubt it's a revision.
