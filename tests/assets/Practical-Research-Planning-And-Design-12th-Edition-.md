But not really. Asking a person to develop a model is a much higher-order task than asking them to copy a model. Describing systems and patterns is way more challenging than selecting the correct description.

Like I did, you probably also have some favorite lessons and activities. Some of these might turn out to be not just fun to teach, but also solid in terms of equipping students with knowledge and skills that will last.
 
Totally agree, I came to the comments to say exactly that same thing! An addendum or follow-up post, imagining what the new assessment for The Outsiders would be and a specific sequence of activities to build up to it, would be super!
 
Thank you so much for this post. I struggle with what my end goal should be when planning based on a topic and I think that this way of thinking will make my life a heck of a lot easier go forward. I plan on trying it out with my juniors next year!

Knowing the phases of the moon may not be of any obvious use to some students, so some scaffolding about how it ties into the real world is important. For example, for me this knowledge has been important in planning stargazing (prefer no moon) or night hikes (prefer full moon). Other fields could be brought in, such as reading literature that mentions the phases of the moon and thinking about why. Or how nocturnal animals hunt or avoid predation. In my experience, students are MUCH more motivated and engaged when they can easily see the relevance of a lesson to things they care about in the real world.
 
USE the current model of the Earth-sun-moon system to describe yada yada yada would be a fine standard, and a great goal to accomplish for a 7th grader. Heck, it would be a fine goal for anyone to remember 25 years after middle school when they have to explain it to their kids.
 
I really appreciate this post about backwards planning. It is so essential that learning be intentional and I think it can be easy for teachers to slowly ebb away from that, especially when we have been teaching for a long period of time and have habits of mind. By starting with assessment it ensures that our students will acquire lasting value in their learning, and application practice. It does take time and thought in the beginning of the planning process but so worth it to help facilitate durable and purposeful learning. Thank you so much for this post!

Hi Jennifer,
Thanks for your detailed overview of backwards design here. There are many benefits to planning this way. Backwards design allows for the teacher to have clear learning goals that are shared with the students (and better yet, developed with the students). When students have a clear understanding of what the learning goals are, we can increase student agency and choice in the pathways taken to achieve those learning goals. This in turn affords us to teach through the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework. UDL is an opportunity to remove barriers for all learners to fully engage in their learning and become self-regulated learners. When students have agency and choice, they can access their strengths to support learning. This learner-centered design is consistent with Self-Actualization conceptions of curriculum. Self-Actualization asserts that the instructional goals are to promote the growth of the individual learner through creativity, problem-solving, and innovation.
 
Clearly established learning goals also affords teachers opportunities to conduct assessment for learning throughout the learning process. Students can be redirected to learning goals throughout the duration of their learning activities to reflect on their work and alignment with the learning goals.
 
Thank you for your insightful ideas. Working backwards from what we want students to know and planning the unit to achieve this makes our teaching more intentional. Knowing at the planning stage enables us to make the learning relevant. Small steps as you suggested to build our less assigned lessons is a great idea. Time is so important for Teachers. Working backwards seems to support better student engagement
 
So clearly and beautifully described. I loved it so much. I wonder if you can also give an example on how you adapted your lesson with the novel Outsiders. As I can imagine with scientific topics in more practical ways than with literature and language. Please help me get inspired.
 
The Horizon Europe European Design Laboratory: the EIC Accelerator calls of the European Innovation Council will take place from 12 to 14 March 2024. This is a new training initiative organized by the European Research Desk of Sardegna Ricerche in collaboration with the Research and Quality Office of the University of Sassari and the Directorate for Research and Territory of the University of Cagliari.
 
The initiative aims to provide practical information for the drafting of successful proposals within the EIC ACCELERATOR calls. This is the initiative funded under the Horizon Europe programme and aimed at providing grants to individual SMEs to enable them to commercialize innovative products, processes or services, in any application area.
 
During the lessons, the entire process of preparing a Phase 1 application proposal will be described and analyzed in detail, illustrating compilation techniques and strategies for each section, so as to allow participants to acquire the basic notions essential for drafting the own application dossiers.
 
- The compilation of part B, through the guided analysis of the PHASE 1 forms, paying particular attention to the correct compilation of the Opportunity, Solution, Competition, Impact, Company, Team, and Funding sections
 
The Laboratory will be organized into two distinct modules (one theoretical and one practical), with the characteristics highlighted in the Program downloadable from the Documents section. The design laboratory activities will then be followed by two weeks of remote tutoring to allow the completion of the project works. The proposals will be evaluated at the end of this process, using the criteria and forms used by the experts of the European Commission; the results of the evaluation will be sent via email and discussed in a video conference between the participants and the EU CORE staff.
 
During the workshop, pre-compiled sections of the application forms will be delivered in electronic format, in order to provide participants with easily adaptable and reusable material for the drafting of their own projects.
 
The laboratory is aimed at employees of companies, universities, research centres, public bodies located in the regional territory which carry out research and development activities and who intend to present projects in response to the EIC Accelerator calls included in the framework of Horizon's European Innovation Council Europe.
 
The European Research Desk reserves the right not to activate the event, notifying the registered participants, if the minimum number of participants is not reached or if causes arise which could compromise the correct running of the laboratory.
 
In the second module, participation of up to a maximum of 20 participants will be permitted, previously selected among the participants in the first module and divided into the following four profiles:
Profile A: employees from companies, research centres, public bodies located in the regional territory (11 places)
Profile B: staff and/or researchers of the University of Cagliari (3 places)
Profile C: staff and/or researchers of the University of Sassari (3 places)
Profile D: n. 3 places at research centers (one for each centre): Fondazione IMC, CRS4, and Porto Conte Ricerche.
 
The following are excluded from participation in the training course:
- companies, bodies and freelancers who provide consultancy/training to third parties necessary for planning, assistance, reporting and monitoring for participation in national, European and international funding;
- natural persons not meeting the criteria set out in profiles A/B/C;
- training institutions or companies that provide training activities.
 
The registration application must be received by Tuesday 5 March. Considering that one of the criteria for selecting the places reserved for our University is given by the chronological order of submission of applications and in order to guarantee equal opportunities (between those who may have already received the news directly from Sardegna Ricerche and those only via notice (email to all) of the University of Sassari), only registrations submitted after the sending of the Notice of 27 February will be taken into consideration. Therefore, those who have already submitted the application are invited to resubmit it by filling out the form again.
 
1) classification at the University of Sassari: priority is given in the following order: professors, researchers, permanent and fixed-term technical-administrative staff, research fellows, doctoral students, contract teachers, collaborators, scholarship holders;
2) involvement in the field of European planning in terms of planning/management/reporting which must be attested for all candidates (with the exception of professors and researchers) by a declaration from the head of the structure they belong to which must be sent to the asai address @uniss.it within the closing deadlines for applications; in the absence of this certification, the priority envisaged by this criterion cannot be assigned;
3) chronological order of submission of the request to participate in the laboratory (s
