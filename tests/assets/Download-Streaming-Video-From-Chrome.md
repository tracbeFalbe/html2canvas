I get it Apple Products are the best hardware according to fans, but this seems like an intentional block from Apple (yet again) to force people to use their stuff and only their stuff. But the product (Apple TV+) says you can watch it from anywhere, but I have NEVER been able to get it to stream on anything other than my apple hardware.
 
Using information found elsewhere, I went into Chrome settings, went to Advanced, selected "restore settings to their original defaults" and it started playing fine. I will try this for Edge as well. Apple TV+ was the only provider with these issues.

Glad to hear it works for someone. I have tried it several times using Chrome and Edge and cleared cache, etc., and it has never worked. I wonder if another browser would work, but if you have a PC and this works I have to say I am surprised.
 
When I click on the button to play, usually nothing happens, and at other times it pops up a black screen (much as other streaming services do) but nothing is there - no play button, no pause button, nothing.
 
To install, download the CRX file into your Downloads folder, then drag the CRX file from the Downloads folder into the Extensions (Menu -> More Tools -> Extensions) page of Chrome. Uninstall previous versions of Moonlight Chrome before installing this version. The extension does not update automatically so check here for updates regularly.
 
If you are stuck at the "Loading Moonlight" screen for more than a minute or so, you may have to manually enable NaCL in your Chrome settings. Type chrome://flags in the address bar and search for the option called "Native Client", click the Enable link for Native Client, and restart your browser.

For new projects, we recommend using theBigQuery Storage Write API instead of thetabledata.insertAll method. The Storage Write API has lowerpricing and more robust features, including exactly-once delivery semantics. Ifyou are migrating an existing project from the tabledata.insertAll methodto the Storage Write API, we recommend selecting thedefault stream. Thetabledata.insertAll method is still fully supported.
 
Ensure that you have write access to the dataset that contains yourdestination table. The table must exist before you begin writing data to itunless you are using template tables. For more information on template tables,see Creating tables automatically using template tables.
 
Streaming is not available through the free tier. If you attempt to use streaming without enabling billing, you receive the following error: BigQuery: Streaming insert is not allowed in the free tier.
 
This product or feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the Service Specific Terms. Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the launch stage descriptions.
 
For fields with type RANGE, format the data in the tabledata.insertAllmethod as a JSON object with two fields, start and end.Null values for the start and end fields represent unbounded boundaries.These fields must have the same supported JSON format of type T, whereT can be one of DATE, DATETIME, and TIMESTAMP.
 
Recently streamed rows to an ingestion time partitioned table temporarily have aNULL value for the \_PARTITIONTIMEpseudocolumn. For such rows, BigQuery assigns the final non-NULLvalue of the PARTITIONTIME column in the background, typically within a fewminutes. In rare cases, this can take up to 90 minutes.
 
Some recently streamed rows might not be available for table copy typically for afew minutes. In rare cases, this can take up to 90 minutes. To see whether datais available for table copy, check the tables.get response for a section namedstreamingBuffer.If the streamingBuffer section is absent, your data is available for copy.You can also use the streamingBuffer.oldestEntryTime field to identify theage of records in the streaming buffer.
 
When you supply insertId for an inserted row, BigQuery uses thisID to support best effort de-duplication for up to one minute. That is, ifyou stream the same row with the same insertId more than once withinthat time period into the same table, BigQuery might de-duplicatethe multiple occurrences of that row, retaining only one of those occurrences.
 
De-duplication is generally meant for retry scenarios in a distributed system where there'sno way to determine the state of a streaming insert under certain errorconditions, such as network errors between your system and BigQueryor internal errors within BigQuery.If you retry an insert, use the same insertId for the same set of rows so thatBigQuery can attempt to de-duplicate your data. For moreinformation, see troubleshooting streaming inserts.
 
De-duplication offered by BigQuery is best effort, and it shouldnot be relied upon as a mechanism to guarantee the absence of duplicates in yourdata. Additionally, BigQuery might degrade the quality of besteffort de-duplication at any time in order to guarantee higherreliability and availability for your data.
 
When you stream data to a time-partitioned table, each partition has a streamingbuffer. The streaming buffer is retained when you perform a load, query, or copyjob that overwrites a partition by setting the writeDisposition property toWRITE\_TRUNCATE. If you want to remove the streaming buffer, verify that thestreaming buffer is empty by callingtables.get on the partition.
 
Newly arriving data is temporarily placed in the \_\_UNPARTITIONED\_\_ partitionwhile in the streaming buffer. When there's enough unpartitioned data,BigQuery partitions the data into the correct partition. However,there is no SLA for how long it takes for data to move out of the\_\_UNPARTITIONED\_\_ partition. A querycan exclude data in the streaming buffer from a query by filtering out theNULL values from the \_\_UNPARTITIONED\_\_ partition by using one of thepseudocolumns (\_PARTITIONTIMEor \_PARTITIONDATEdepending on your preferred data type).
 
If you are streaming data into a daily partitioned table, then you can overridethe date inference by supplying a partition decorator as part of the insertAllrequest. Include the decorator in the tableId parameter. For example, you canstream to the partition corresponding to 2021-03-01 for table table1 using thepartition decorator:
 
When streaming using a partition decorator, you can stream to partitions withinthe last 31 days in the past and 16 days in the future relative to the currentdate, based on current UTC time. To write to partitions for dates outside theseallowed bounds, use a load or query job instead, as described inAppending to and overwriting partitioned table data.
 
When the data is streamed, it is initially placed in the \_\_UNPARTITIONED\_\_partition. When there's enough unpartitioned data, BigQueryautomatically repartitions the data, placing it into the appropriate partition.However, there is no SLA for how long it takes for data to move out of the\_\_UNPARTITIONED\_\_ partition.
