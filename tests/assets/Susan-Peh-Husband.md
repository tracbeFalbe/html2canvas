Josh Powell, the husband of missing Utah mother Susan Powell, set off an explosion at his Washington home today that killed himself and his two sons, who were there for a supervised visit, police said.

Josh Powell's lawyer, Jeffrey Bassett, said he received an email from the man minutes before the explosion that said \"I'm sorry, goodbye,\" but he didn't see it until two hours later, when he was informed of the blast.
 
Bassett told The Associated Press he knew his client was upset about being denied custody of his sons at a court hearing last week, when he was ordered to undergo a psychosexual evaluation and polygraph test in order to get them back.

Graham, Wash., Deputy Chief Gary Franz told ABC News that a Child Protective Services (CPS) worker had just dropped off Powell's two sons at the house for a supervised visit. Powell took his two sons inside the house and then locked the CPS worker out.
 
\"The children were just right in front of her as she was walking up to the door,\" Child Protective Services spokeswoman Sherry Hill said. \"They went into the house and Josh shut the door right in front of her and locked it.\"
 
Firefighters arrived at the scene and found the three bodies. Police are awaiting verification from the Medical Examiner's Office, but said they believe the bodies are those of Josh Powell and his two sons.
 
Josh Powell is the only named person-of-interest in Susan Powell's 2009 disappearance, but he has not been charged. The couple's two sons were placed in custody of Susan Powell's parents in 2011 after Josh Powell's father, Steve Powell, was arrested on charges of voyeurism and child pornography.
 
At a hearing Wednesday, a statement from the West Valley City, Utah, police noted that information and images were found on Josh Powell's computer that \"specifically related to their children's welfare,\" according to ABC affiliate KTVX in Salt Lake City.
 
The police did not specify what the information was, but Judge Kathryn J. Nelson ruled that because of that information, Josh Powell would not be allowed to have his children back until he submitted to a psychosexual evaluation and a polygraph test, the report said.
 
The children were to remain with Chuck and Judy Cox until Josh Powell's next hearing, which was scheduled for July. Josh Powell was allowed twice-weekly supervised visitations with his sons during that time, KTVX reported.
 
It is more likely that there is something getting trapped in his denture that is causing the smell. It would be easy for food to get caught there along with other bacteria. That could make for a pretty bad smell. The next thing you need to is get him something like a waterpik which will help him to get that denture truly cleaned out every day.
 
Replacing dental implants is not as simple as taking one set out and then replacing them with another. When the current implants he has are removed, they will take bone with them. In order to replace the dental implants, he will first have to have a bone grafting surgery in order to build up the lost bone. Then, after that is healed, it will be time to place the new dental implants.
 
If we do the math that is one surgery to remove the implants, one surgery for the bone grafting, then one surgery for the new dental implants. That is three unnecessary surgeries when there is no real reason to replace them. That is putting your husband through a lot.
 
The pain of losing a child is unnatural and indescribable. There is a hole in your heart that will never close and never heal. I lost my son to suicide in August, 2017. But seven months later, I also lost my magnificent husband.
 
David's death was earth-shattering. There was so much pain and numbness. I kept thinking about how I had carried him for 9 months, I had felt his life inside me, and that had brought me a depth of love only a mother could know.
 
My husband Michael felt responsible, often lost in the feelings that he could have done more for his son. Our friends and family shared in our pain and felt the pain that we experienced. We were loved and cocooned. It wasn't my loss, it was our loss.
 
Deaths of this nature can rip a marriage and a family apart, but David's death did the opposite. My husband Michael and I were closer than ever, protecting each other, loving each other even more, if possible. Our daughter Elizabeth brought us so much joy and jumped in to attempt to fill the gaping hole in our family.
 
And then we returned from a vacation and Michael was convinced his gallbladder was acting up again. Testing revealed a mass. Over the next eight weeks, I stepped into the role of cheerleader, guidance counselor, and caretaker. I tried to believe I could make Michael better and that we could get through this.
 
Often, as the sun dimmed at the end of the day, we would lie in bed together and tell stories to each other. He particularly loved to hear me tell stories. As we lay together, me in the crook of his shoulder, listening to his heartbeat, we would reminisce about our meeting, our early married life, the birth of the children, their accomplishments, and our love. It was the one place I felt safe, that the world would spare us, as long as I was enveloped in his arms.
 
We often spoke about what we meant to each other. We were going to grow old together, walk into the sunset together. We felt fulfilled in our love, but I felt robbed that our love story was ending too soon.
 
It was difficult and it was dark. But Michael was an optimist. And he hoped. Hope is a word I generally struggle with now. He did not think that death was as imminent as it was. But his decline was so rapid, and Micheal died eight weeks after his diagnosis.
 
I felt Michael was going to our son David, spiritually, and that brought me comfort. I always picture them together, loving, laughing, as souls travel in pairs. I have reconciled that Michael had to go to David to protect him, which is why he had to leave us, while I needed to stay and protect Elizabeth. I understand this force as a parent.
 
On March 18, 2018, as I prepared to bury my husband, I remember thinking: "Don't ever utter, 'things can't get worse,' because they can." Over a thousand people attended Michael's funeral. Shiva, our seven-day mourning period, was brutal, necessary and mind-numbing. I wanted to leave and go home, but this new life was my home. I felt completely enveloped by the situation, without an escape.
 
There are still triggers and there is still pain. But I am making another chapter, a right turn. I'm moving forward with Michael and David on my shoulder. I recently went to our little bucolic cemetery in Sag Harbor, New York, where my men are buried. I cried; it was brutal. I miss them every day.
 
But there are new relationships to forge and new experiences to have. I have chosen to wake up ready to become a better version of me, most days. There is so much more of me to grow and discover. I have one shot at this life, and it is my overwhelming desire to give it everything I've got.
 
There, I underwent an endoscopy and the pancreatic cancer was found. I was alone, because my husband was undergoing chemo for his own cancer, and so was stuck at home. I underwent more tests, and had a port put in. Then I was sent home.
 
Also, at the time of my diagnosis my husband was having health problems. He had what he thought was a pinched nerve but turned out to be a bad response to his chemo. He had to be hospitalized. It was a very stressful time for us.
 
I began working with oncologist Dr. Basir Haque and his nurse practitioner Karen DuBois at Kadlec. I was on a heavy chemo regimen. For each treatment I spent eight hours in the clinic and then went home with a chemo pack that I wore for the next 48 hours. After that I went to Kadlec to have the chemo pack removed. I had this treatment for most of the summer of 2021. Unfortunately I spent a lot of that time in the hospital, due to side effects from the treatment, such as diverticulitis.
 
**In 2008 I wrote**: As some of you know, Bill and I have been married for 43 years. We have weathered 14 moves, along with major life transitions, and huge personal changes that come with uprooting and relocating a marriage, children, home, lifestyle, and relationships.
 
I asked Bill to share some of his thoughts, fears, and feelings during our difficult years of moving. I hope this will give you insight to understand your husband, and know how to best encourage and love him during a move.
 
I feel that If I had known what was going on in his head and heart then, I would have worked harder (and prayed more) at bridging the gap between us. I am amazed and humbled to know that anything I said or conveyed through my actions during those years was received as he has described below.
 
I have learned over the years that **the total disruption of a marriage and family who move takes its toll on every member of the family**, but not as much as on the relationship between husband and wife.
 
Oh Susan, thank you for sharing.
So inspiring and beautifully written from the depths of his spiritual heart.
 And your respond, oh I could feel the depths of your love
from your words.
 Bless you my sister and Hugs to you this day. ?
 
Suzy would be proud, I am sure, of the fact that 32 years after her sister promised to find a cure for breast cancer, a woman with stage four of the disease has nearly an identical survival rate as she would have had 50 years ago.
 
I think too many people in situations like this are expected to live up a Hollywood fantasy of what kind of cancer patient or spouse of a cancer patient you should be. Perfect. Saintly. Sucking it up with a smile.
 
Stan Komen might well have bailed. Or he could have just as easily gotten tired of being the one to hold down a j
