What if you do need help choosing the right statistical tool, or interpreting your process-specific output? You can get personalized statistical support through our Statistical Consulting service, starting with a free 30-minute session.
 
Our statistical consultants are expert statisticians who can help you design effective experiments, collect the right data, perform intensive analyses, interpret your results, and more. They provide support on-site, or by phone, email, or web conferencing.

The technology you have elected to purchase or obtain may tend to pose barriers to participation for some users, and it is recommended that you and your IT support person submit an Equally Effective Alternate Access Plan and be completed before deployment of this technology.

Minitab is a Windows-only application and Minitab Express is available for Windows and Mac. Minitab and Minitab Express are also available for use by all current students and faculty on their personal computer for academic purposes.
 
Note: Older versions of Minitab do not support the new "sign in" method for licensing. If you see a prompt asking for a license file with no option to sign in, please uninstall Minitab and download the latest version.
 
To get Minitab or Minitab Express for your RIT Owned computer, please contact your Systems Administrator.
If you have any questions or trouble with the installation, please contact the RIT Service Center.

Statistical package that provides a broad range of basic and advanced data analysis techniques. It includes regression techniques (general and logistic), analysis of variance, experimental design, control charts and quality tools, survival analysis, multivariate analyses (principal components, cluster and discriminant), time series, descriptive and non-parametric statistics, exploratory data analysis, power and sample-size calculations. Minitab also supports a wide range of graph and chart types.
 
This introduction to Minitab is intended to provide you with enough information to get you started using the basic functionality of Minitab. Of course, you will learn more about Minitab and its capabilities as you proceed through the course you are taking.
 
Penn State users have access to the Minitab Web App, the cloud-based version of the software. All faculty and students who use Minitab software for coursework will need to order the Minitab Web App. See: How do I access the Minitab Web App.
 
The Minitab Help and How-To documentation provides step-by-step instructions on using Minitab to analyze data. The individual course notes will also provide details for each specific use of Minitab within that course.
 
To copy output appearing in the Session window, select the desired output using your mouse. To copy a graph window, make the graph window active by clicking anywhere in it, and the select **Edit** > **Copy Graph**.
 
To save your work as a Minitab project, select **File** > **Save Project As...**, and provide an appropriate filename in the dialog box. Minitab projects are given a ".MPJ" extension. For the purpose of this course, you may consider creating one project for each lesson, and thereby naming the projects lesson1.MPJ, lesson2.MPJ, and so on.
 
A complete Help file is incorporated in Minitab, which provides you with instructions, examples with interpretations, overviews and detailed explanations, troubleshooting tips, formulas, references, and a glossary. Open Help by choosing **Help** > **Help** or by clicking on the Help button on every dialog box in the software.
 
Last, but not least, remember that Minitab provides a support team staffed by professionals with expertise in the software, statistics, quality improvement, and computer systems. Visit the Minitab support web site or call +1-814-231-2682 to speak with Minitab's technical support specialists.

If you are trying to activate Minitab 15 and you see the following error message, **Activation server currently unavailable** or **Activation Server is unreachable**, you may be attempting to do one of the following:
 
Proxy servers analyze the incoming and outgoing packets to determine the source and destination of the IP addresses and may be preventing your software from being downloaded. To solve this issue, try to activate Minitab from somewhere that does not use a proxy server. However, many campuses and work environments do have proxy servers in place as a security measure.

 
Some internet satellite connections have latency/lag, which causes a connection timeout when you try to activate Minitab. To solve this issue call Kivuto at 1-866-435-4722 and a Kivuto customer support specialist will assist you. Note: The support specialist may ask your permission to access your computer remotely to guarantee the connection during the activation.

 
Most campuses filter the traffic coming and going through their security system (i.e. firewalls, anti-virus software, etc.). These security systems might disable the activation process. To solve this issue try to activate Minitab from another location such as your home computer.
 
Windows and Mac Minitab licenses for the desktop apps expire on December 31, 2021. The Minitab web app replaces the desktop client and is available now using any web browser, except Firefox. Simply log in using your University computing account credentials. Your work can be saved locally or to cloud storage services, including Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.
 
Note that current desktop versions of Minitab can still be used until the license expires. Minitab for Mac no longer receives support from the vendor and the current version will not work with new versions of macOS or new Mac (M1) chipsets.
 
The QUAD Center provides basic support in the use of statistical software packages, with the greatest emphasis on SYSTAT and Data Desk, both of which are available for use over the university network. The Center also provides support for SPSS and Excel (see below) and will eventually provide limited support for Minitab and Sigmaplot.
 
**Minitab** is a comprehensive, commercial PC-only package available on most campus PCs; at present, the Center provides very limited support for Minitab, mainly through Professors Friedrich and Strawn. Some faculty members on campus are regular users, however, and are possible sources of support.
 
I would like to plot the projection of this response surface similar to the minitab example given, but I can only get the curves in the JMP surface predictor (which doesn't interest me, in this case: I want to plot it similar to the minitab example):
 
Unfortunately, I do not see a way to get what you want from within the Fit Model results. Graph Builder, as indicated by @txnelson , has the ability to create the graph that you want. Unfortunately, that is not tied to a model, so you get a contour plot that is created by triangulation. This can lead to the rough appearance when you have a sparse amount of data.
 
In the dialog below the prediction profiler, change the setting from Fixed to Random > Uniform for the two factors that you want on the contour plot (check to make sure the ranges are appropriate for those factors). The other factors leave at Fixed, but put them at the setting that you wish for them to have.
 
You can adjust the smoothness and number of levels on your contour plot with the Graph Builder by changing the cursor level next to "Smoothness" (to have curvy frontiers instead of broken lines) and adjust the number of levels (on your example by default on 4, but you can increase/decrease this number of levels).
 
**Cost:** In most cases, the campus-wide license allows MSU to provide the software at no extra cost, however in some the license allows the software to be offered at a discounted price much lower if purchased individually.
 
The license enables students, faculty and staff to download the software directly from the MathWorks site at no additional cost, for use on or off campus. Free access to the MATLAB Academy Online Training Suite (see details below) is also part of the license.
 
**Students:** SAS offers a FREE version of their software called SAS University Edition for Windows, Mac and Linux. Downloads and Installation guides can be found at this link: SAS OnDemand for Academics | SAS
\*\*Please note, support for installation is provided from SAS directly.
