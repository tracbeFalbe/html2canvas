Hi! I used your micro deck and i found it incredibly useful! Now that i am trying to download the pharm deck, it says the decks arent available anymore :/ Are you going to re-upload them? Thanks again!
 
Thank you so much for putting your work into these decks! It was recommended to me by another M2 and it has been fire in terms of retention. Using your decks with the printed Sketchy Medical Notes PDF for focused visual associations.
 
For example, if I watched the benzodiazepine sketchy video and only wanted to do the anki cards associated with that video, would there be a way for me to easily find and just review those cards? Thanks for the quick reply!

Ah, I get your question now! Haha. If you have downloaded the deck, you will see that the cards are separated by subject. The folders are separated into cardio/renal, antimicrobials, antineoplastics, autonomic drugs, GI/endocrine, neuro/psych, etc. So you can study those folders selectively, but not by specific video. That being said, you can easily edit the deck to your pleasing. You if you wanted to add tags, you could do that for yourself ?
 
Yes! You can download them via the link in this post ? it will take you to a google drive. Are you having issues? If so, first try downloading to your computer with the Anki application downloaded already. Then, you can sync your Anki account to your phone.
 
I personally didn't find these types of study techniques to be helpful, but I had a lot of classmates who liked learning this way. Just not my thing. However, I think PicMonic is good because the clips are short and to the point - they're usually just a few minutes long so its easy to maintain attention and you can watch a clip anywhere quickly. Sketchy med clips were longer and so a more elaborate storyline to follow. These are decent supplements to help learning during didactic year. During clinical year, I use UpToDate through my school library to look things up more than anything and of course PANCE review books.
 
In my experience, micro wasn't nearly as detail oriented in PA school as it was in Med school. I did not use those sources in PA school, did great in micro, but didn't really remember much at all. In med school, I used pathoma and sketchy, and I remember literally everything from sketchy and will remember those details for years. Many friends used picmonic too and loved it. However, those sources might be too detailed for PA school, so I wouldn't want you wasting time memorizing things you won't be tested on. In PA school, time is limited as it is. Also, I'd recommend finding the PDF versions of sketchy if you can, it's basically the picture, and a bunch of bullets points describing what each detail represents. That way, you don't have to waste time watching the video. Since I've done it both ways, (with and without those sources), I would highly recommend them for long term retention.
 
I have two of the three--picmonic and pathoma.

In retrospect, picmonic was ok but after using for the first round of exams or 2 I moved to pathoma and never looked back. I would buy it again in a heartbeat (and probably will as review for the PANCE). Its a great time saver and the explanations are on point.
 
I loved sketchy pharmacology. Some of their videos are up on youtube or you can watch a few samples on their website and see if it is for you. I also used it occasionally for micro. A bunch of us shared a login.
 
I haven't tried Pathoma yet but SketchyPharm has been a lifesaver for me. I can watch a video once and remember details on the medication months later just by recalling the storyline. I watched a few Picmonic videos and I feel that Sketchy is more memorable in general.
 
In regards to sketchy pharm, how can I start the free trial on there? I would just like to try it out before paying for it... I do see "start your free trial" on their website but every time I click it, it brings me to the checkout screen with no other choice but to pay for the whole subscription. I emailed their company but just curious if any of you have any experience with that.
 
I am in an MSN program for midwifery and will be taking advanced pharmacology this Spring. We will be lumped in with physical therapists and all other MSN and BSN to DNP tracks for this class. Pharm is challenging for me, so I asked a friend who is a pharmacologist what he recommends to help me internalize a ton of material in a short time. He recommended Sketchy Pharm. He said a lot of medical students use it and the residents where I work confirmed this and said it is good.
 
So, has anyone used Sketchy Pharm for their pharm class or boards? If so, which focus did you do? I feel like PA might work, but have no idea how their school or licensing exams actually work. I think medical is probably overkill and nursing is definitely not going to work for advanced pharm. I like the idea of the way they teach the concepts. Hopefully somebody here has personal experience with this tool and can offer some insight.

Sometimes taking notes or adding facts can help increase learning retention. With Picmonic, students can customize their content and add their own information and characters, notes, images, videos and more to satisfy their personal learning needs.
 
Bottom line: You can create your own Picmonics using the simple drag and drop authoring tools, then share your creations with friends or the world! And on that note, anything shared publicly is also available to you too! Meaning thousands of additional topics covered in the Picmonic for Medicine library.
 
Picmonic is research-proven and covers a large variety of topics from medical, nursing, pharmacology, biology, pre-chemistry, and tons more. It features a mobile app on Android and Apple so students can learn on the go, and for medical students, a Google Chrome extension. Students who use Picmonic can also tap into their creative side to make their own memorable mnemonics.
 
Picmonic lessons are short yet concise to cover topics while focusing on active recall and retention. Picmonic also has spaced repetition with daily quizzes, prerecorded webinars, customizable learning playlists, and community contributions!
 
Sketchy and Picmonic can both be helpful for the USMLE Step 1. While both utilize mnemonics, Picmonic creates opportunities for quicker, research-proven preparation for big exams like the USMLE Step 1. When in doubt, check out why Med students use Picmonic to crush their exam scores.
