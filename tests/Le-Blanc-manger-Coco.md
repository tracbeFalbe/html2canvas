Blanc-manger coco recipes across the Web are highly variable with people sometimes including egg whites and mixing different types and quantities of coconut and dairy condensed milk. In my recipe, however, I discarded the egg whites and used almond milk instead of dairy, condensed milk so that the blanc-manger coco is egg free, gluten free and lactose free and still (apparently) has the same great taste as the real thing! As far as coconut milk is concerned, you can either make it yourself by pressing/squeezing grated coconut or go the easy way (like I did) by taking it from a can. The cherry on the cake is the mango coulis to be enjoyed with the coconut-flavoured dessert. Enjoy!

If the blanc-manger coco is one of Martinique's desserts par excellence today, its origin goes back to the beginning of the Middle Ages in the region of Persia. It would then have been introduced into Europe by Arab merchants. At the time, blanc-manger was a savory dish! It was around the 17th century that Europeans would have made it evolve into a sweet dish. This is how he would be brought by the French to Martinique at an unknown time.
 
Released in 2014, **Blanc Manger Coco** is a party game that has sold more than 1.5 million copies. The designers, Thibault Lorcy and Louis Roudaut, claim their game as "the best game to play while having aperitif" on the market. Although the name originally evokes a Caribbean pastry, Blanc Manger Coco has now left the culinary sphere to enter the world of fun.

Blanc Manger Coco is an atmosphere game with irreverent humour, non-political correctness and transgression. To appreciate it, it's better to love dark humour. To the question: "Is it OK to laugh at everything?" For both creators, the answer is a capital "YES" and they prove it with their game.
 
Blanc Manger Coco is inspired by the American game Cards Against Humanity, which Louis Roudaut's brother brought back to France after a trip to the United States. The two co-designers then decided to take up the concept again, adapting it to the French language. Blanc Manger Coco was born!
 
The game is based on the principle of the exquisite corpse, a collective writing game invented by Jacques Prvert that consists of composing a sentence without taking into account previous contributions.
 
Faced with this resounding success, the authors have developed a range of games and expansions that constantly renew the concept. Today the game has more than 4,000 cards spreaded within the complete set.
 
During the lockdown, the creators of the game didn't stand idly by. Always looking to create social bonds, they decided to put online a 100% free version of the game. This digital version, renamed for the occasion Blanc-manger-coconfinement is available on the Simmer.io platform.
 
**Blancmange** (/bləˈmɒnʒ/,[1] from French: blanc-manger [blɑ̃mɑ̃ʒe]) is a sweet dessert popular throughout Europe commonly made with milk or cream and sugar, thickened with rice flour, gelatin, corn starch, or Irish moss[2] (a source of carrageenan), and often flavoured with almonds.
 
Blancmange originated at some time during the Middle Ages from the older Middle Eastern muhallebi,[3] and usually consisted of capon or chicken, milk or almond milk, rice, and sugar; it was considered to be an ideal food for the sick.[*citation needed*]
 
The origins of the blancmange have long been believed to lie in the introduction of rice and almonds in early medieval Europe by Arab traders.[4] Recently, it has been shown that there have been similar Arab dishes from that period such as muhallebi.[5] Muhallebi or another similar dish from the medieval Islamic world, spread to Europe under closely related names and variants, including *blanc-manger* in France, biancomangiare in Italy and manjar blanco in Spain. Additionally, related or similar dishes have existed in other areas of Europe under other names, such as the 13th-century Danish hwit moos ("white mush"), and the Anglo-Norman blanc desirree ("white Syrian dish"); Dutch calijs (from Latin colare, "to strain") was known in English as cullis and in French as coulis, and was based on cooked and then strained poultry. The oldest recipe for blancmange is from the oldest extant Danish cookbook, written by Henrik Harpestrng, who died in 1244, which dates it to the early 13th century at the latest. The work may be a translation of a German cookbook, which is believed to have been based on a Latin or Romance vernacular manuscript from the 12th century or even earlier.[6]
 
The "whitedish" (from the original Old French term blanc manger) was a dish consumed by the upper-classes and common to most of Europe during the Middle Ages and early modern period. It occurs in countless variations from recipe collections from all over Europe and was one of the few truly international dishes of medieval and early modern Europe. It is mentioned in the prologue to Geoffrey Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*[7] and in an early 15th-century cookbook written by the chefs of Richard II.[8] The basic ingredients were milk or almond milk, sugar, and shredded chicken (usually capon) or fish, often combined with rosewater and rice flour, and mixed into a bland stew. Almond milk and fish were used as substitutes for the other animal products on fast days and Lent. It was also often flavoured with spices such as saffron or cinnamon and the chicken could be exchanged for other fowl, such as quail or partridge. Spices were often used in recipes of the later Middle Ages since they were considered prestigious.
 
On festive occasions and among the upper classes, whitedishes were often rendered more festive by colouring agents: the reddish-golden yellow of saffron; green with various herbs; or sandalwood for russet. In 14th-century France, parti-colouring (the use of two bright contrasting colours on the same plate) was especially popular and was described by Guillaume Tirel (also known as Taillevent), one of the primary authors of the later editions of Le Viandier. The brightly coloured whitedishes were one of the most common of the early entremets: edibles that were intended to entertain and delight through a gaudy appearance as much as through flavour.
 
*il est plein d'une liqueur blanche, paisse & sucre : elle est entierement semblable au blanc-mang , qu'on sert aux meilleures tables de France; c'est une chose fort saine, & des plus delicates qu'on puisse manger*[9] 
[It is full of a white liquor, thick and sweet, which is entirely similar to *blanc-mang*, served at the best tables in France; it is a very healthy thing, and one of the most delicate things one can eat].
 
In the 17th century, the whitedish evolved into a meatless dessert pudding with cream and eggs, and later, gelatin. In the 19th century, arrowroot and cornflour were added, and the dish evolved into the modern blancmange.
 
The word blancmange derives from Old French blanc mangier. The name "whitedish" is a modern term used by some historians, though the name historically was either a direct translation from or a calque of the Old French term. Many different local or regional terms were used for the dish in the Middle Ages:[10]
 
Though it is fairly certain that the etymology is indeed "white dish", medieval sources are not always consistent as to the actual colour of the dish. Food scholar Terence Scully has proposed the alternative etymology of bland mangier, "bland dish", reflecting its often mild and "dainty" (in this context meaning refined and aristocratic) taste and popularity as a dish for the sick.[10]
