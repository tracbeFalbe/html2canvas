There is currently no similar drawing software available on the iPad. Please consider developing a portable version that can also expand its utility in various contexts. Although I already have the desktop version, I don't mind spending money to purchase it again.

I cant believe we have not heard anything about this topic from Escape motions. I create on my ipad all the time everyday on other Apps in their inferior versions of watercolour and I keep thinking why am I not able to paint with Rebelle on my ipad.
 
Wacoms are static as thus not very useful. I dont bother wasting my time on rebelle anymore because it can only be used at home, where I want to rest, not in the office where I actually need the app / tablet to create and visualise.
 
I too would really appreciate an iPad IOS version of Rebelle. I would even be happy(ish) to pay a subscription, although I would rather it was priced like the Mac version. I would also be very into beta testing any version of an iPad Rebelle
 
Not only for painting on the go, which will be also very nice. But also for the comfort. I can paint very well with tablets on the desktop. But for drawing it's very hard for me. iPad it's much more comfortable, and this is what i use when i need to do complex drawings.
