Since I create graphics for newspaper, I'll also comment on its ability to perform under daily deadlines. I'm not really interested in numbers so you won't see much benchmarking - go to Macworld or Barefeats for those. I'm only interested in how predictable the computer is. Whether under stress will it start to show strange things, such as screen redraws, inability to switch from one app to another, missing palettes in software, inability to save files, inability to launch apps. I've an office computer (WinXP) with better specs than the Mac Mini but shows all those problems.

The (non-exclusive) advantage of the Mac Mini is of course the ability to pair it up with your own display. Apple displays and that from the iMac are brilliant, but not excellent. If you work for print, and require colour accuracy for reproduction, you have to get a non-glossy screen. If you don't need that level of control over colours, the iMac might be a better buy. Personally, I prefer non-glossy screens. I can't even stand the gloss on my iPad. If you're putting your computer facing light source or windows, there will be gloss.
 
**The Fusion Drive feels like a single 1TB SSD**. You get snappy performance for opening applications, opening and saving huge files, copying files from USB3 or the SD card slot. Overall user interface is very responsive.

For the price that Apple is selling their Fusion Drive, they should be providing a 256GB SSD instead. On the bright side, 128GB is more than enough for storing the OS, applications and handling daily file transfers. For example, 500 RAW photos at 30MB each is only a 15GB import. After you finish working on those photos and don't access them for a period of time, they will be transferred automatically to the slower 5400RPM hard drive for storage, releasing the SSD storage capacity. It all happens behind the scene without you realising.
 
I've read comments from people saying they like to have manual control on where their files go. As such, they opt for a separate SSD and hard drive. They put their working files on the SSD and then move them to the hard drive after finalising. But I don't know what happens when they have to edit the finalised version, which happens all the time. All these manual file moving is just a waste of time, which is why I favour the Fusion Drive option. There's not much point to the technology if it doesn't save time.
 
I've also tried filling up the SSD portion and proceeded with the usual tasks, e.g. importing RAW photos. Everything still feels snappy until it hits the boundary where the data starts loading onto the hard drive instead of the SSD. Past that boundary, when you open up files, they still feel snappy, even for 1GB+ Photoshop files. But let's face it, when you open such a big file, you will expect it to be slower.
 
The usual brands for RAM are Kingston, Crucial, Corsair and Transcend. The difference is price. I don't expect performance to be significantly different, at least not in a noticeable way compared to the Fusion Drive. I got the cheapest.
 
Add more if you like to leave multiple (and I mean a lot) applications open simultaneously. One good gauge on how much RAM to get is to open the Activity Monitor and look at your typical memory usage.
 
The integrated graphics card can drive resolution up to 2560 by 1600 from high-end 27 and 30 inch LCD monitors. However to go beyond the 1920 by 1080 resolution, you need a mini Displayport to Displayport adapter (cheap), or a Dual-link DVI cable (expensive).
 
I tested the 3D capabilities with the Sketchup modeling software. With Sketchup, the graphics card can handle high polygon scenes without significant lag. In the scene above, there are 5 high-polygon models each about 8MB in size. There's some slight lag during panning, but nothing I would complain about.
 
Launching applications is fast and they are responsive. There's no screen redraw even when working on several huge files. I attribute that to the Intel HD 4000 which is quite a performer despite what other people might say.
 
For art and graphic design, the Mac Mini handles flawlessly. If you work with multiple applications or on huge files (500MB Photoshop or Illustrator files anyone?), it is recommended to get more RAM. There's no lag or spinning beach balls when working on several huge files at the same time.
 
If you're short on RAM however, applications can behave strangely. E.g. Adobe Illustrator will fail to save files, unless you quit other applications to release memory. Adobe Photoshop might show up blank palettes. When that happens, I've to quit other programs to release the memory so that I can save or export files. Get more RAM!
 
One downside that's not really related to Mac Mini is user habits during graphic design. Just because you can make the file big doesn't mean you should. I prefer linking into Illustrator files rather than embedding.
 

The USB 3 and SD card slot are blazing fast at importing photos. I tested the SD card slot with a UHS 95MB/s SD card and it can import files at the speed of the card. If your camera cable is only USB 2, you might want to use the SD card slot, assuming you have a fast SD card. Class 10 SD cards are much slower to import, of course.
 
Speaking of HDMI, I tried the HDMI output and the colours are too washed out, and bright, especially on a LCD monitor. That's after advanced calibrating using the System Preferences. With HDMI on HDTV, the colours are fine.
 
Apple has added some rather important features that should have added a long time ago, namely, the USB 3 ports and the SSD & hard drive combination (now working together as a Fusion Drive). Those two components make the computer fast and responsive. Even the integrated graphics card turned out to be quite good.
 
I highly recommend the Fusion Drive for medium to semi-heavy production needs. You can then add RAM yourself when you find the need to. The 2.6Ghz quad-core upgrade is probably for those who edit video a lot. The unit can run quite hot if it's rendering continuously, and I'm not sure if the fans are enough to cool the unit, but the processors do slow down when things get hot.
 
This isn't really a review as such, rather a short write up of stuff that can be found on other websites for years and great prrof that not every blog entry in the world is needed. In fact, very non-pro writing style, with some mixed in pictures / logos that are taken from Apple.
 
I'm only interested in how predictable the computer is. Whether under stress will it start to show strange things, such as screen redraws, inability to switch from one app to another, missing palettes in software, inability to save files when there's not enough ram. I've an office computer (WinXP) with better specs than the Mac Mini but shows all those problems.
 
I also have the 2006 Mac Pro (upgraded with GeForce 8800 card). Aside from not being able to upgrade the OS to Mountain Lion, my biggest annoyance with it is the slowness in launching iTunes and iPhoto (15K photos).
 
I would recommend the quad core 2.3Ghz since video work is more reliant on processing power. As for Fusion Drive, it depends because it benefits mostly launching of OS & apps, importing and transferring files. If you're up for it, you can fit in a SSD in the future, or if you can't be bothered, you can go with the Fusion Drive from the start.
 
Thanks for the review! Have you tried after effects or premiere pro on it?
According to adobes systemrequirements you will need a 7200 rpm harddrive for the CS6-versions of those two applications, but maybe the fusiondrive work even though its a 5400 rpm?
 
Nice to see a blog who really understands the ins and outs of computing devices how it relates to specific programs! Great review. I am a photographer who mainly works with Photoshop, and it's nice to see that it does well on a Mac Mini. May pick one up by the end of the year.
 
I strongly disagree. As you say there are other reviews out there which are often technical. They are useful too, essential even, but Parka's review is the "human" point of view, and it's a great complement.
 
In general I hardly understand why people like you take time to destroy other peoples' work without bringing anything. There is nothing wrong nor dishonnest in his review, so if you just don't find it useful for you, move on silently.
 
Just wanted to pick up on the point about the 5200RPM drives. It seems you think these computers can handle CS6, which presumeably most Macs do. but is a 5200 drive a nightmare to work on in a production sense, and would for example the 7200RPM drive be preferable (if SSD is not an option?) I have noticed that Apple have more or less univerally popped the slower (but 2.5") drives in most of the lower end specs on all the machines.
 
The only 5400RPM drives I've used for video editing are from the USB3 and Firewire800 external drives. But I only worked on 720P 25FPS and 1080P 24FPS, and the hard drives are able to handle them well enough.
 
Thanks for the clock speeds, very good information. I work mostly as a graphic artist, so does that change your thoughts on this at all, sorry if my comment was misleading. Most of your article seems to talk about print/press production. I work in web as it happens and often see large PSD files with many layers as well as Illustrator and I'll often have Bridge and a code editor open.
 
There should not be any problems with huge files. As you can see from the charts above, the Fusion Drive and the SSD can open files at 250MB/s. The Mac Mini startup time from power to desktop is only 7 seconds.
