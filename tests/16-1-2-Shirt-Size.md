The Soothe Shirt is meant to fit like shapewear to both hold the weight of baby and provide support for your postpartum body. Measure your underbust with a soft measuring tape, making sure to keep the measuring tape level all the way around. If you're between sizes, size up!
 
Your baby's head should be above your breasts and high enough for you to kiss. If you need help, reach out to our Customer Care Team and we will be glad to help you find a good fit in your Soothe Shirt.

Sizing & Buying Guides | We're here to help!You will find three body styles when shopping online for our Premium T-shirts. Here you will find the sizing charts for each so you can easily make a comparison between the Classic Fit vs Pro-Fit and Tall fit styles. All our tees are made from the same thick heavyweight fabric you have come to trust when buying high quality men's shirts.
 
How do you pick the correct t-shirt size? You will want to consider the style as well as the actual measurements when you consider what size to get. All our tees will give you a more boxy fit but the pro fit style will be a little more narrow in the body as well as in the sleeve. If you are wearing the shirt under a button-down you may want to consider the pro-fit that matches your measurements the closest.
 
On each HeavyTshirt product detail page, you will find the size chart that matches that particular shirt. Be sure to pay attention to the body style you are buying as they differ in width and length.

A popular addition to our men's t-shirt collection is the Pro Fit. It sits a little closer to the body and has a narrower sleeve. The neckline still hugs close to the body as with all our tees and it is still made with our super thick 100% cotton.

**For best accuracy, see the t-shirt size chart below and compare the chest and length measurements to a shirt the child currently wears.** Our t-shirts are generally true to size compared to similar cut t-shirts. If between two sizes, choose the larger of the two. If you are still unsure about the size, please take a look at our super-friendly return policy, which will ensure you get the right size at no extra cost if you order the wrong one initially.

Please use a shirt you feel comfortable in as reference.
For accuracy, use a shirt with no stretchy qualities.
Lay completely flat before measuring.
Handle all shirt dimensions with the tape measure and shirt taut.
Always measure in straight, precise lines.
 
When you tuck the shirt in, at the very front the two sides of the shirt tails separate and make for a gap in the shirt right below your belly button. The lack of alignment can make the shirt look sloppy.
 
The university stripe shirts are a great and versatile way to boost your wardrobe. The material is among the best I've seen for oxford cloth, even after a few washes it still maintains a smooth and shiny feel. The shirts look amazing with a navy blazer but also on their own they're a quick way to up your look. I now have two of them in yellow and pink and am considering a few more :)
 
Our clergy shirts are intended to be a trimmer, more modern fit than most clerics available in the United States. Please see below for estimated measurements for both our short and long sleeve options. When in doubt, we recommend using neck size to be your ultimate guide, or going with the larger size (don't forget, we have free exchanges if needed!).
 
Forcing the estimate into one of a fixed set of sizes allows the process to go quickly while still producing a result that is at least within the same zip code as a more detailed answer. The idea is not to pin down the schedule precisely but rather to get a back-of-the-envelope feel for whether a project is a two-week project, a two-month project, or a two-year project.
 
Standing with your arms by your side, take your tape measure and wrap it around the widest part of your chest. To guarantee accurate numbers, the tape needs to be level all the way around and parallel to the ground.
