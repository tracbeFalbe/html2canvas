ChessBase Reader 2017. The new ChessBase Reader conveniently displays all installed databases and training titles - with a modern menu ribbon look. With the free ChessBase reader, you can open all standard file formats (.cbh, .cbf, .pgn), play through games on a stunningly rendered board, watch ChessBase training videos and much more. Download it for free now! **Free download available here.**

I may be mistaken, but I don't think these two are competing products (especially since they are from the same site). The chessbase reader is simply a different tool, which focuses on reading formats of chess. I personally write this off as useless. It's a company making proprietary services and then selling a program to unravel what doesn't need to be unraveled if they just used common formats already existing.
 
Chessbase is the actual program. Chessbase reader is a freebie stripped down version. You get a taste of what the real one is like, plus you can read their files. Chessbase is not cheap, but it is used by the vast number of pros, from what I am told. I have Chessbase 11 and haven't updated because of the price, but I use it every day (I am definitely not a pro); terrific program. Using CB's own proprietary format allows CB to have more functionality within a database than simply using PGN would permit. HTH
 
Chessbase is an incredibly useful piece of software that allows you to work with chess databases, including your own. It allows analyzing games, finding games with similar openings, positions, content (like sacrifices), endgames, etc. I use it very close to daily, and my rating is hardly stratospheric.

Chessbase reader exists primarily as a method of using various DVDs produced by Chessbase on openings, etc. For example, there is a DVD on the London System by Simon Williams. It mixes a small database of analyzed games with video, test questions, etc. Chessbase reader will allow you to use the contents of that DVD without buying Chessbase.
 
As stated, I use it almost everyday, and it has been money very well spent. But that doesn't mean everyone would find it so, or that even most people would find it so. Another factor to consider is that if the past is any indication, a new version will be coming out this fall.

Chessbase Reader 2017 is a freeware that only allows viewing of chess databases, no creating or analyzing features are present on this software. Chessbase 14 is also a reader, and is also capable of analyzing, arranging and creating game databases. Since it has this wide range of features as oppose to a freeware version, it comes with a price - which is depending on someones taste if it can be expensive, cheap enough, or well paid product.

you will mostly see the difference when you both installed the two, compare the options available, and see how you can use the tools. For chessbase reader 2017 though, you can load databases created in chessbase format. Which means, even if you can't buy any stuff from chessbase, then at least you can still use their database format by installing the freeware program.

One of the reason they might be doing this is to produce more advertisement for their product. You will notice that the freeware version has some sort of advertisement while using the program (in the upper right portion of the window). Encouraging you to buy the paid version of the product, and introducing their other premium products.

In a nutshell, chessbase reader is a freeware version with very limited features and an embedded advertisements for their products. chessbase paid version is a feature-rich, and no ads software.

I personally used the paid version once, but since I don't have it personally, I can't navigate or experiment yet on that paid version (I just use it from my friend who purchased it).

Hope that one gives concise details about your question.



 
When you go on their website, they will provide you a downloadable link for this freeware version, but the examples you're going to see from their screenshots are coming from the paid version. So you really need to use that program yourself to see the appearance of the program. On the other hand, the paid version has product reviews from youtube, so you can really see how the paid version works before you decide to buy it.
 
I played a very interesting game today, and I entered it in ChessBase reader, along with some comments. I would love to save this game in a database (.cbh) or as a .pgn, but I don't know how. Can you please help me?
 
It is not possible to do this in chessbase reader. You can use Arena Chess (free) to do this then transfer this .pgn into Chessbase Reader. Reader allows me to use Chessbase products for training but to evaluate my own games I use Arena.
 
I would recommend ChessDB which claims to be the best free chess database program out there, although that was in 2007 ;-). It is quite powerful for a free program with the ability to download from TWIC from within the program. Also import from a player's ICC history. You can hook up to UCI interface games engines.
 
Of course you can save your games into a database but you cannot import Chessbase format. It has good search capabilities for a free program like player reports and search for games with exact position match.
 
While you cannot save new games with chessbase reader, you can edit and replace existing ones. So what I do is open a .pgn file (I created one and copy and rename it for each tournament) full of empty games and edit these, i.e. double click an empty game, enter the moves and comments, then right click the game in the list and select replace which lets you edit the metadata and writes the game to the .pgn file. Only the site tag seems to be unavailable, but if you edit it manually, cb reader will display it if the tournament name is short enough.
 
I just downloaded Chessbase reader 2017. The design is wonderful the ability to annotate is very useful. However, unlike SCID vs PC (the software for reading and annotating chess games that I am used to) I can't find any option to **save** the annotation.
 
I tried Ctrl + S after adding some test annotations to a Fischer Taimanov game, but nothing pops up to ask which file to save to, or if the annotations need to be saved in a special chessbase format. I can't even seem to find the save button anywhere.
 
Chessbase used to supply a free cut-down version of Chessbase called Chessbase-lite which allowed this up to something like 32,000 games. The last version was in 2009 but that has not been available for many years now. If you want writing capability then you have to pay for the full version.
 
In order to avoid heavy server load and client-side busy script errors, file size is restricted to 10 MB. This covers most of the game databases offered for download throughout the Internet. But even with a few hundred games there may be some seconds delay. Please be patient! Remark that I switched to the new ChessBase reader and the result page opens a new browser tab now. This change became necessary in order to improve the usability on mobile devices.
 
It appears that sometimes the file selector in Webkit browsers fails and the uploaded file has zero length. I can reproduce this on MS Edge only; Chrome works fine here. Posting the games via clipboard always works.
 
This normally happens if there is a blank line missing between the single games. Probably the blog engine collapses two consecutive line breaks. Then the PGN parser assumes only a single game followed by some rubbish.
 
Chessbase is chess database only for Windows. There is android version of chessbase but have some limitations. The only way to run chessbase on Mac or Linux is using Wine. Wine is emulator to run Windows Apps under Linux. I believe they have a Mac version too. It call Micro Wine. I run Chessbase 12 and Houdini 3 with Chessbase 14 and the MegaDatabase 2019 on Ubuntu 22.10LTS without no problem. You can install Stockfish16 too. ?
 
**It is not possible to** **save a chess game in a database (.cbh or as a .pgn) in chessbase reader.**You can use SCID Chess (free) to do this then transfer this .pgn into Chessbase Reader. Reader allows one to use Chessbase products for training but to analyse game I suggest using Arena or SCID.
 
Most importantly you can save your games into a PGN database (but you cannot import Chessbase format). It has good search capabilities for a free program like player reports and search for games with exact position match. I will be explaining all that in a separate article.
