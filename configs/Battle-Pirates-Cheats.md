OK, so I followed the advice of MikalSerity and quickly made a stack of money. Someone earlier gave the walkthrough for the Tear main mission. I did it all and then I looked for Vilem Hein.   
  
TWO TIPS:  
  
Vilem Hein: He is always on a galleon (or whatever is the name of the most expensive ship available). But it might be a merchant or battle, not neccesarily a pirate ship. The quickestr way to find him is to go to a port, such as Antalya, and hang round the port engaging every ship that leaves. If he is not on it then retreat from combat. When no more ships appear go north, off the screen, then south back to the port. Everytime you leave the screen more ships are generated randomly. In this way you can engage lots of ships quickly. Eventually you will find him.   
  
Combat: The best way to win is to ram the other ship without taking damage or damaging the other ship. Board it. Kill everyone on board and take their ship. Ships are expensive to repair, but crew can be bought cheaply.  
  
When I engaged Vilem I took too much damage trying to ram and retreatred. Nonetheless I still won. You are then given a mission called 'escare's piece of crap'. The game then conveniently crashes.   
  
It might be conincidence, but I got bored looking for Vilem and called my ship- where are you?. I found him immediately after this. Might help, can't hurt.   
  
Thanks to all for all the tips.
 
lol thanks everyone, this guide is AMAZING. but i have a question and was wondering if anyone could fix it. i reloaded the game after saving it and my main mission went from finding the diamond arc to the dark crystal. help! (P.S. i never visited Banland).

Trade tip: A easy way to make money is to buy plenty of cofee in Taijeng.(Cofee is what they called in the game)Sell them in Mythine, You will get around double the price you bought the cofee. Amber cost alot of money to buy, but most of port don't buy it for alot of price. Silver, glassware, copper, carpet, cotton cloth, and liene cloth is also a good way to make money. Your trading lvl will be high. But most recommanded is cofee trading. Clove is good when start a job to buy good.

Rogue online gamers have designed, sold or used computer code to crush competitors playing the popular "Fortnite" survival video game, spoiling the experience and the creator's profit potential, the game's maker charges in a series of lawsuits.
 
Cary, North Carolina-based Epic Games has sued three Americans and six foreign gamers from Sweden to South Africa for hacks that undercut the game played by more than 10 million players worldwide. The lawsuits, which were filed in North Carolina and California, allege violation of the game's copyright and terms of use contract. One of their targets may be a 14-year-old Delaware boy.
 
Cheating gamers are able to overpower their opponents by using tools that allow them to see through solid objects, impersonate other players and make moves other players cannot, according to one lawsuit. Up to 100 people can play the game at a time.

When cheaters "gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly," Epic Games spokesman Nick Chester said in an emailed statement. "We take cheating seriously, and we'll pursue all available options to make sure our games are fun, fair, and competitive for players."
 
"Fortnite," which costs nothing to play online, generates revenue by charging players for cosmetic options, like different outfits for their virtual character, which don't give players an edge against rivals. Some video-game makers are aggressively cracking down on cheaters, who they fear could drive away eyeballs from advertising some developers sell, said Kevin Greene, who teaches entertainment law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego.
 
None of the nine defendants could be reached for comment. Two U.S. residents in Louisiana and Minnesota and one Canadian did not have listed telephone numbers matching addresses where court summonses were sent. Two Russians, one Ukrainian, one Swede and one South African did not respond to emails sent to addresses listed in court documents. The Minnesota man, Charles Vraspir, is negotiating a settlement to the lawsuit, Minneapolis attorney Mick Spence said.
 
But in a letter to the North Carolina federal judge hearing one case, a Newark, Delaware, woman described one defendant as her 14-year-old son. Lauren Rogers said in the letter that the boy didn't modify "Fortnite," but instead obtained the tools from an easily accessible public web site that Epic Games should be suing instead. As a minor, the boy isn't able to agree to the terms and conditions of using the game, she said.
 
The Epic Games spokesman did not answer when asked whether the company knew the player it sued was a minor before filing its case. The lawsuit said the boy has used fake names to keep playing "Fortnite" despite being banned more than a dozen times and posting videos on YouTube showing himself using the illicit software and displaying links to a web site distributing the cheats.
 
"Epic is not okay with ongoing cheating or copyright infringement from anyone at any age," Chester said in an email. He didn't respond when asked whether the company has also sued web hosting or other companies used to distribute the cheating code, or how those targeted were identified.
 
A 1990s-era update to federal copyright law sets up procedures where companies can demand that online service providers like YouTube remove material that violates the companies' rights. The person or company that posted the challenged material can counter with a statement that the material isn't illegal. But it's largely unknown that challenging the takedown notice can give U.S. courts jurisdiction over foreign residents in the dispute, said Xuan-Thao Nguyen, who teaches intellectual property law at Indiana University.
 
"I think legally they were right but the backlash against them was enormous," Greene said. Video-game makers "have to be careful from a public relations standpoint that, yeah, they might win the battle but they could lose the war."
 
Appeal by defendant from a judgment for plaintiffs in an action to recover damages for the breach of an oral agreement granting defendant the **[82 Cal. App. 2d 800]** right to the exclusive use of the title, "Queen of the Flat Tops," for all purposes except the right of plaintiffs to continue to use the title in connection with the publication of a book.
 
Stanley Johnston, referred to as the "author," was on the aircraft carrier Lexington in the battle of the Coral Sea in May, 1942. Shortly thereafter he wrote a book entitled, "Queen of the Flat Tops," subtitled, "The U.S.S. Lexington And The Coral Sea Battle." The book was published and copyrighted in the United States in 1942 by E. P. Dutton & Company, Incorporated, referred to as "Dutton." It was one of the first books published to treat in detail of the activities of an aircraft carrier and its crew in combat. The book is nonfictional. It relates historical facts, warfare in the Pacific. It does not contain any fictional character or characterization as such, or any plot or theme. The author and Dutton at all times have be
