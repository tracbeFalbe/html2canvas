Ideally, yes you should change the patch panel and termination jacks to Cat6a standard to get the full advantage of the Cat6a features. In particular you would need Cat6a patch panels and termination jacks to maintain the Cat6a shielding capabilities thoughout the whole run. With this in mind, you should also make sure that your patch cables are also Cat6a compliant.

With 5e you already have Gigabit (at least in theory). You can use Cat 6 cables on a Cat 5 or Cat 5e switch and patch panel. The frequency response of Cat 6 is better than 5e and far better than Cat 5.
 
Category 5 cable (Cat 5) is a twisted pair cable for computer networks. Since 2001, the variant commonly in use is the Category 5e specification (Cat 5e). The cable standard provides performance of up to 100 MHz and is suitable for most varieties of Ethernet over twisted pair up to 2.5GBASE-T but more commonly runs at 1000BASE-T (Gigabit Ethernet) speeds. Cat 5 is also used to carry other signals such as telephone and video. This cable is commonly connected using punch-down blocks and modular ...
 
1000BASE-T (also known as IEEE 802.3ab) is a standard for Gigabit Ethernet over twisted-pair wiring. Each 1000BASE-T network segment is recommended to be a maximum length of 100 meters (330 feet),[a] and must use Category 5 cable or better (including Cat 5e and Cat 6). Autonegotiation is a requirement for using 1000BASE-T according to Section 28D.5 Extensions required for Clause40 (1000BASE-T). At least the clock source has to be negotiated, as one endpoint must be master and the other endpoin...
 
From the wikipedia article (and my own experience), "While category 5 components may function to some degree in a Gigabit Ethernet, they perform below standard during high-data transfer scenarios. To support Gigabit Ethernet, a higher performance version of cat 5, enhanced cat 5 or cat 5e has been added to the standards."ï»¿
 
Since you are now CAT6 end to end you are all set. You should consider testing your cable with a Fluke or getting someone to do it for you so you can certify it and be comfortable you have what you paid for. The cable and terminations all need to be installed properly to get peak performance.

We have decided to not replace the Cat5 for all and simply add a new Cat6 patch panel to the comms rack and add new ports to the offices that are currently sharing via the 10/100 hub scenario mentioned above.
 
I have a standard tester for confirming the twisted pairs are working both ends (8 cycling green - success / red - failure lights) and have read that performing a large internal file transfer will give at least a rough indication of the transfer speeds received.
 
Lift some ceiling tiles and inspect the condition of the premise cable. It must not be laying on ceiling tiles, or routed near fluorescent lights. It must be supported by J-hooks every 3 - 4 ft, and not under any physical stress.
 
What do you project your workstation bandwidth requirements to be in the next 3 or 5 years, or before you might need to relocated to another building? Might not be worth sinking a ton of money into it, and not see the return on your investment.
 
Firstly I tested via one of the users in the old office who have one of the new 1GB Cat5e ports. Their network adaptor shows them connected at 1GB and the data transfer fluctuated (as expected) and went from 35mbs - 87mbs.
 
I then performed the same transfer test from one of the users in account sharing via the 10/100 hub and their transfer speed was from 7mbs - 10.7mbs max! - clearly highlighting the intolerable bottleneck they currently suffer.
 
I am currently plugged into the old Cat5 port and my network adaptor shows a 100mb connection, showing that the current Cat5 is only giving me a 100mb connection compared with the Cat5e 1GB. I then performed the same data transfer and got roughly 10mbs transfer rate also.
 
As a final test I got two users in accounts to perform the data transfer simultaneously and their transfer speeds drop to @ 5.5mbs showing that sharing the connection is definitely causing performance degradation on top of the already poor performing Cat5 ports.
 
As an aside, with the user on the 1GB connection; I went into the adaptor settings and looked at this Jumbo Frame setting, the possible options are from 2KB MTU - 9KB MTU or disabled. I tried the upper and lower limits and both caused the network speeds to grind to a halt. Not sure if it is simply I chose the wrong setting or if this only works with a 10GB network card, but leaving it disabled seemed to performed the best.

**48-Port Patch Panel for High-Speed Cat6 Network Cabling**
Organize and manage your high-density Cat6 application without taking up too much valuable rack space. This patch panel offers 48 RJ45 ports with color-coded 110 punch-down slots that are terminated using a proper punch-down tool. Both the front and rear connectors are clearly numbered and labeled (for custom naming) to help you identify individual cable runs. The patch panel supports T568A and T568B wiring standards.
 
**Condenses 48 Ports into Just 2U of Space in Your 19 in. Enclosure or Open Frame Rack**
The UL-approved patch panel supports mounting in 2U of EIA-standard 19-inch racks using the included hardware, freeing up valuable rack space for other equipment. It is fully rated for 1 Gbps data transfer speeds to connect security cameras, sensors, routers, computers, switches, wireless access points and other network devices in your network application.
 
**Product Overview**
A patch panel is a device which contains a number of RJ45 ports. Patch panels are used for connecting incoming and outgoing wires of a local area network (LAN) or a telecommunication system. In a LAN, the patch panel connects network computers to each other and switches or hubs with patch cables. Patch panels also give the benefit of organization for a clean network deployment.
Our UL Listed Cat6 patch panel exceeds TIA and ISO component specifications, supporting network convergence protocols delivering maximum bandwidth and extended reliability for all LAN, multimedia, and Power over Ethernet applications. To the front of the panel each port is numbered and has a designated label area for clear port identification.
 
Manufactured from sheet metal these panels are supplied with a robust rear cable management tray for cable strain relief and neat cable dressing. Port numbering is provided on front and rear of the panel and individual ports may be color coded for site specific network administration.
 
The panel features the unique DataGate Category 6 connector which includes an integral ingenious spring loaded shutter that not only protects it from dust and contaminants but it also ejects improperly seated patch cords. The DataGate connector is dual color coded for either 568A or 568B wiring and supports high-speed data transmission. The product is backwards compatible with C5e systems.
