Could some kind person tell if it is possible to install keypass into a qnap ts251d nas.  
If so How.  
Because I don't want to use a Cloud, instead Use My Own Cloud so to speak.  
So that the data base is high and dry where I would be the only person to have access to it.

We recommend storing the database in the same location that you use it, i.e. on C: in your Documents folder, along with all your other data.  
Then you can backup your data to your NAS and get the KeePass database as well.
 
Qnap firmware is the newest possible (we have updated it few days ago, believing this would solve the problem). We also disconnected every other shares from QNAP (now it is dedicated storage for commvault, for keeping additional copies of backup).
 
I cannot log in to qnap right now, but I found that the default block size for Qnap is 32KB (and I believe that this is current block size on this qnap - it was configured using default settings - not by me).

There is an antivirus installed on commserve (cvcs) - it is WithSecure Elements Agent (before F-Secure). We created an exclusions for every mount path, for every DDB directory, indexcache directory, software cache etc. This antivirus does not have firewall service activated - commserve is using default Windows Firewall.
 
This QNAP aux jobs are running very very slow. We have another secondary copy to MCSS (metallic), and this copy have a mirror configuration as QNAP copy (copying the same jobs). And copy to mcss takes around 2hours (to transfer data through WAN) but copy to QNAP takes around 8hours (qnap is accessed locally - through LAN). I think this problem when occurs - stops the job - waiting for some time - and then resumes the jobs. I think when we fix the problem with this errors above - then copy to QNAP will take a lot less time then today.
 
I remember that quite some time ago I read about broken SMB implementation in QNAP devices. This was in competition newsletter and since QNAP devices are pretty popular with their customers, they did some fine tuning to overcome QNAP implementation of SMB protocol.
 
In this case switching means, create new iSCSI volume, map it to the mediaagent, move data path and remove the old SMB share. That is if you have required free space to do so. In our case it was a fresh installation and performance issues came up very early, so discarding everything and starting over on new volume was an option.
 
Wherever you are, myQNAPcloud allows you to be always connected to your QNAP device. When traveling abroad, you can download files right away, or record your favorite moments and then immediately upload it to your QNAP device. Even if you accidentally lose your smart phone, don't worry about it! Because your data has already been safely stored on the QNAP device at home with myQNAPcloud, and those files will never get lost.
 
myQNAPcloud strives to ensure that you can access files on the QNAP device anytime, anywhere. It's a fluent experience. Create a new file at school or in your company first, browse the files with smart phone on the way home, and then complete your report comfortably on your desk when you return home. With multiple supported applications on Windows PC, Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Android you can watch a movie stored on the QNAP device at home anywhere, or upload photos to the QNAP device to automatically.
 
With the web-based file management on the myQNAPcloud website, you can easily upload, download, move, copy, and more. Or just click to share them to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Weibo. If you have more than one QNAP device, you can streamline your management with myQNAPcloud, as with only one interface can manage multiple QNAP device.
 
Even if you computer is suddenly damaged, or your phone goes for a swim, your data is always safe on a QNAP device. And unlike with public cloud services such as Dropbox and Google Drive, the private cloud provided by a QNAP device has no privacy or security concerns and provides a safe, reliable area for your files.
 
myQNAPcloud Service provides remote access solutions for users who purchase QNAP products to access their device via the Internet. Accessing a server outside a local area network (LAN) environment can sometimes be a headache with the time & effort needed to set up complicated port forwarding settings on the router.
 
To solve this problem, myQNAPcloud Service provides an "Auto Router Configuration" function to help users configure the router automatically as long as a user has registered a QNAP ID and has signed it into QTS (the QNAP device). But there are still some limitations: for example the router should support UPnP function. So we come to another solution called "myQNAPcloud Link".
 
myQNAPcloud Link is the best remote access service provided by myQNAPcloud that allows you to connect to your device via the Internet using the myQNAPcloud website (www.myqnapcloud.com). No complicated port forwarding settings on the router are required: just install myQNAPcloud Link App on device App Center and sign in QNAP ID on your device. Then you can access files from the myQNAPcloud website. myQNAPcloud Link will select the best connection for you according to your network environment. In addition to the web-based connection, myQNAPcloud Link also allows you to connect to your QNAP device with QNAP Mobile Apps Qfile, Qmanager and the PC utility Qsync. myQNAPcloud Link makes remote connectivity so easy.
 
myQNAPcloud is a service that allows users to access their QNAP device remotely via the Internet. Before using the remote access service, you need to register a myQNAPcloud account (QID) using your email address. Alternatively, you can sign up using a Google or Facebook account on QNAP account center.
 
You will receive a confirmation email after completing the registration (please check your spam folder if you do not receive it.) Once you receive this email, please open it and select "Confirm Registration".
 
2-3. After entering your login details, please create a name for your QNAP device. You can also reuse an existing device name (if you reuse an existing device name, the previous device will be automatically logged out from myQNAPcloud). The name of your QNAP device will act as a link for you to access it anywhere as long as you can access the internet (for example: mydevicename.myqnapcloud.com).
 
2-6. After registering your device using the myQNAPcloud wizard, a summary page will display all the registration details and services guidelines. You can always check the latest features by visiting the myQNAPcloud features page.
 
After completing the myQNAPcloud wizard, you can now access your device from the website (www.myqnapcloud.com) or you can connect via the QNAP mobile app (you can download this app from Google Play and the Apple Store.)
 
If the auto router configuration was unsuccessful during the myQNAPcloud wizard setup, it may be because your router does not support UPnP, is not properly set up, or is incompatible. However, with the Qfile app, you can always access your device on the same local network.
 
myQNAPcloud SSL certificates are used to provide a secured connection between the QNAP NAS and web browsers, providing authorization as well as encrypting the connection to secure data and transactions. Before installing a myQNAPcloud certificate, an error may occur when you try to connect to your QNAP NAS using HTTPS (for example: ). The data transmitted in the connection is not protected against security threats. Unauthorized users have the potential to intercept data being sent between a QNAP NAS and web browser.
 
6. Click "Follow" when you have finished setting up the task. Now the device will begin downloading the shared link's content. You can manage your follow tasks in Following. Click the "update status"button to check the progress of your download.
