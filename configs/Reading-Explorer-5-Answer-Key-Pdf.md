In Hong Kong, the set I bought was just 4 levels - Beginner, Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced. The 4 books contained more or less the same material as the 6 books. The books were simply divided differently so the Hong Kong books had more pages in each book. The cost is higher in Hong Kong than in mainland China IF the version you buy in Mainalnd China is printed in China.
 
If you buy online, you'll want to check to see if you are getting a physical book or online book. Also to see if it is the latest edition. The images shown are for the 2nd edition which is what I bought when I was in China.
 
In the US, Amazon.com sells the books, but as you might expect, the price is higher in the US than China. While checking for this blog, I noticed the US Amazon site shows a newer edition. They now have the 3rd editon. It does appear the US version now has the same 6 levels as China starting at Foundation and ending at Level 5. The US Foundation, 3rd ed version is shown below the Chinese Taobao advertisement image.
 
Now you get to the first page of the reading. Again, it asks you questions BEFORE you start reading. This is one reading skill. Predicting and thinking what you might read about. They also give you a topic related image.
 
The first actual reading part of the Unit. The lines are numbers and words are highlighted in red. These are the key vocabulary words they want you to learn. Note the reading section here isn't very long. 1 page.
 
Next is a section USING the new vocabulary including other forms of the word. Maybe the reading used the noun and now they see if you can understand the adjective or the reading uses one tense and now you need to use a different tense.
 
Now you know why I chose the 2nd unit - one of my favorite foods - chilis / chiles / chilis. As I mentioned at the beginning, this particular book is a little out of date now. It was the first edition and today they are on a 3rd edition. The Ghost chile is no longer considered the hottest in the world.
 
The final section is designed to watch a short video and answer questions. I just discovered I didn't scan those 2 pages but ot resembles the above 2 pages but refers to a video. The video DOES NOT come with the book or at least it didn't come with mine. I suppose they want you to buy it separately. Note the answers to all the exercises are also NOT included with the book. They sell a teacher's book that has the answers but I never bought one.
 
Reading is the best way to improve vocabulary and also helps with learning grammar since you see it being used. I had every one of my IELTS students using this material to mprepare them for IELTS - it helps both with the reading sections of IELTS, the listening sections (If you understand the topic you are listening about it improves your recognition of what they are saying) and writing and speaking - again the knowledge of different topics you gain help you talk and write about the topics they give you on the exam.
 
N2 - Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is the task of answering a question over a paragraph of text. While neural MRC systems gain popularity and achieve noticeable performance, issues are being raised with the methodology used to establish their performance, particularly concerning the data design of gold standards that are used to evaluate them. There is but a limited understanding of the challenges present in this data, which makes it hard to draw comparisons and formulate reliable hypotheses. As a first step towards alleviating the problem, this paper proposes a unifying framework to systematically investigate the present linguistic features, required reasoning and background knowledge and factual correctness on one hand, and the presence of lexical cues as a lower bound for the requirement of understanding on the other hand. We propose a qualitative annotation schema for the first and a set of approximative metrics for the latter. In a first application of the framework, we analyse modern MRC gold standards and present our findings: the absence of features that contribute towards lexical ambiguity, the varying factual correctness of the expected answers and the presence of lexical cues, all of which potentially lower the reading comprehension complexity and quality of the evaluation data.

Is there any way to create a correct answer for essay questions that WILL NOT be visible until the correct answers are posted? If you put it in the "general feedback" it is visible to students immediately upon submitting their quiz which means they now have the cor
