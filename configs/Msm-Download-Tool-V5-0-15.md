I've been working with AWS lambdas for a few months. I was working with a lambda and it was fine at the end of the day. I came back to work on it the next day, and I can't get Visual Studio to even start the application using the Mock Lambda Test Tool.
 
I ended up creating an empty lambda that just returns the input (the standard project code that AWS gives you as a template) and that won't even run. I hit the play button to star the Mock Lambda Test Tool, it looks like it will run for a couple seconds, then it closes down. The command window does not even pop up.
 
The target process exited without raising a CoreCLR started event. Ensure that the target process is configured to use .NET Core. This may be expected if the target process did not run on .NET Core. The program '[16700] dotnet-lambda-test-tool-2.1.exe: Program Trace' has exited with code 0 (0x0). The program '[16700] dotnet-lambda-test-tool-2.1.exe' has exited with code -2147450726 (0x8000809a).
 
I have tried re-installing the AWS toolkit, and also tried re-installing Visual Studio. This is an issue with VS 2017 and VS 2019. I just installed 2019 to see if that would fix the issue. Any help would be appreciated.
 
I came to this question having the very same issue. After installing AWS Toolkit I found that the lambda test tool was not installed and therefore I got the same error just as the OP. The only difference is that I was targeting .Net Core 3.1 and therefore I needed amazon.lambda.testool-3.1. However this answer should work for both scenarios.
 
In the official project site, which can be found here, there are the instructions to install the tools. It also says that installing the latest version of AWS Toolkit should be enough to have the tools installed (it was not in my case and probably in yours).
 
And since the project is still in preview I just had to find the latest stable version in order to specify it in the command. For .net core 3.1 here is the nuget site, there I found version 0.10 to be the latest, so the command should look like:
 
**Failed to create shell shim for tool 'amazon.lambda.testtool-6.0': Command 'dotnet-lambda-test-tool-6.0' conflicts with an existing command from another tool.Tool 'amazon.lambda.testtool-6.0' failed to install.**
 
For anyone else that hits this same issue, it had to do with the the AWS toolkit install. I did not modify it, but somehow it was no longer working. I tried un-installing and re-installing, but it was still having issues running it. A co-worker sent me the exe and subdirectory that was setup on his machine under C:\Users\%user%.dotnet\tools. The exe is located in this directory, and there is another folder under .store for amazon.lambda.testtool-2.1. That directory had different folders and files than what I was able to install. So I copied in what he had and it worked. There might be a profile file associated to the tools install that points to these folders and files that might need to be modified. Since I was able to fix it with this, I didnt look any further into that.
 
I upgraded a function from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6. I already had the path for the lambda test tool defined in the launch settings and the .NET 6.0 tool already existed in the directory because AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio 2022 was installed.
 
I noticed if you open the Project properties and make no changes and launch the AWS .NET 6.0 "Mock Lambda Test Tool" it works but this is only for the current session and when Visual Studio 2022 is restarted the problem is repeated.
 
I removed the **$(Configuration)** variable because it is blank on starting Visual Studio 2022 and this results in this error. However if I load the project 'Properties' tab before launching the test tool then the $(Configuration) variable is internally populated with the current output type DEBUG or RELEASE and the test tool loads!
 
My temporary solution is to remove the write permissions for the current active user only on the launchSettings properties file (so that the corrected file is not reverted). This seems to be a bug in Visual Studio 2022 as I did not experience this in Visual Studio 2019.
 
I used to do this easily in V4.XX by selecting a short length of line and changing its width and the default value by right clicking the line and changing the parameters there. It would remain with the same width for any lines on the same layer through the whole editing time of the board.
 
What I would like to do is draw lines on the Dwgs.User layer say at .02mm by default, then if I need a thicker size for something else, set that from the line properties (right click) tab. As this will only be for a small number of lines it is not a problem to do each one individually.
 
@paulvdh Thanks for that. The problem I have is not dxf related.
@JeffYoung It is supposed to do that, as is the Edit/ Edit text & Graphics tab (presumably)
One of my PCB manufacturers asks for narrow profile layers so used to use .01mm in V4.0.x and they were OK with that.
I have to do some corner cuts on the board I am laying down now, and have set a drawing layer to 0.01mm. I set the PCB edge cuts to .05mm with the Edit tab and every time I select the edge cuts layer the width shown is 0mm. image19201080 286 KB
This sets the edge cuts to an impossibly fine line, but as the diagonal line can be selected by mouse drag, its properties change to width = 0, and the next click gives me a message that the line width must be greater than 0, (which makes sense). I can set the selected line to .05mm but the rest of the layer remains at 0.

All very confusing.
It appears that if a line is drawn, it is fine and can be changed in its own properties tab, but then if the layer line width is changed or even set to the same value in the edit tab, then the line width is set to 0 on its properties tab. It appears to apply to the dwgs.user layer as well as PCB edges. I have not yet tried any other layers as am confused enough!
Has anyone else had this issue? I wonder if it is confined to windows only, or maybe windows 7 o
