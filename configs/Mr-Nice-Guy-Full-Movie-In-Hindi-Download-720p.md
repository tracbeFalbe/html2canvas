When used effectively, the **be nice.** action plan - to notice, invite, challenge, and empower - encourages individuals to challenge themselves and others to seek appropriate professional help when they notice mental health changes or concerns. This program equips individuals in schools, businesses, faith institutions, and communities with the knowledge and confidence to take action when it comes to mental health and suicide prevention.
