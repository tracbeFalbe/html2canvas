I downloaded a door family from the out of the box commercial door file, its the Door-Passage-Single-Vision-Lite, when i insert the door it offsets the frame beyond the wall. Below is an image. Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to solve?

The trick to solve your problem - look at the dor family in the family editor - look at the floor plan. Look at the dimensions for the reference planes at the width of the wall. The door and frame geometry are locked to those reference planes.
 
the door family worked perfectly! Thank you. I would like to know how to edit this door family too, and i understand your explanation but i'm not sure which constraint to edit in this family. I've attached an image of the plan below, and i was hoping you could show me which constraint is the right one.
 
From the screenshot that you had attached, it seems that you wish to constrain geometry to reference planes. The trick is to place a reference plane in the position that you want the geometry to be. Reference planes are the "bones" of Revit families. They control the dimensions and performance of geometry in the family
 
1) Start with reference planes. If you want to create a box 2'x2'x2', then in the plan view you will create reference planes for the length and width, and in a front or side view you will create reference planes at the top and bottom of the geometry
 
Also - if you click on a piece of geometry, you will be able to see which reference planes they are constrained to because the padlocks will show up next to the item the geometry is constrained to. Unlocking the padlocks will remove the constraint.
 
I have double doors that will not align with the center of the wall. When I go to edit the family and put an EQ/EQ dimension at the center line of the wall and try to constrain the dimension, I get an error that constraining the dimension would over constrain the family.
 
**Beyond the Wall**[1] and **north of the Wall**[2] are generic terms employed by the people of the Six Kingdoms and the Kingdom of the North to refer to the large area of Westeros that lies north of the Wall. It is the only part of the continent that is not part of a realm, and thus the only place where particular attention is given to the difference between "Westeros" (the continent), and "the Six Kingdoms" and the Kingdom of the North (the two realms to the south of the Wall).
 
It is inhabited by tribes that refer to themselves as the "Free Folk", known by the people of the Six Kingdoms as wildlings. The wildlings themselves are not politically unified but consist of numerous and diverse groups. Many are semi-nomadic hunters, due to the impracticality of agriculture in the far north. Some wildlings are little more than savage and primitive raiders, but other groups live in small settled communities and villages.
 
The Free Folk sometimes refer to these lands as "the real North", because they are actually located north of the northernmost kingdom of Westeros, which is named simply "the North" - and they think it odd to say that "the north" is *south* of where they live.
 
The lands beyond the Wall are mostly uncharted. The region immediately north of the Wall includes the Haunted Forest, a vast taiga-forest which covers most of the area, extending from the Wall to the furthest uncharted north.
 
The forest extends from the eastern coast to a large mountain chain in the west known as the Frostfangs. The Frostfangs extend an unknown distance to the north and are quite inhospitable. However, there are rumors that even the northern Frostfangs contain hidden valleys, heated by volcanic activity, which are actually the most hospitable regions north of the Wall, and heavily settled by the wildlings.
 
Southwest of the Frostfangs there is a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the sea known as the Frozen Shore, a harsh area inhabited by fierce and primitive warriors who frequently cross the Bay of Ice to raid the lands in the North sworn to House Stark. This small area is totally enclosed by the Frostfangs, which run southeast to northwest, and the ocean.
 
Beyond all of these areas, in the furthest north are the Land of Always Winter. The forest ends and gives way to these truly polar regions, which are unexplored. The White Walkers are rumored to originate in the depths of the Land of Always Winter.
 
The Free Folk living north of the Wall have a hardscrabble, survival-based economy, with little settled agriculture. Most of their economic activity is fixated on hunting and gathering: they live to catch what they can eat, and they eat whatever they can catch. They use no official currency, as they are more interested in obtaining things that are directly useful to them, and thus function on the barter system.[3]
 
However, the wildlings do engage in at least some long-distance trade: the heavy furs of local animals adapted to the harsh cold of the extreme north are fairly valuable, and they often trade them to passing smuggler ships in exchange for iron weapons, which they cannot forge on their own. In past centuries the Night's Watch tried to stop the fur-for-iron trade along the coasts, but in recent centuries as their numbers dwindled they abandoned any attempts to prevent passage around the Wall by sea.
 
Author George R.R. Martin has stated that the land-area inhabited by the Free Folk beyond the Wall is vast, roughly the size of Canada: "There's actually quite a lot of Westeros north of the Wall, it's a large expanse of land, probably as large as Canada."[4]
 
*The World of Ice and Fire* companion book features a map of Westeros and western Essos that shows a significant amount of land north of the Wall, possibly extending further east and west as well, backing up the suggestion that the lands beyond the Wall are vast.[5]

"**Beyond the Wall of Sleep**" is a science fiction short story by American writer H. P. Lovecraft, written in 1919 and first published in the amateur publication *Pine Cones* in October 1919.[1]
 
A former intern and a worker of a mental hospital relates his experience with Joe Slater, an inmate who died at the facility a few weeks after being confined as a criminally insane murderer. He describes Slater as a "typical denizen of the Catskill Mountain region, who corresponds exactly with the 'white trash' of the South", for whom "laws and morals are nonexistent" and whose "general mental status is probably below that of any other native American people". Although Slater's crime was exceedingly brutal and unprovoked, he had an "absurd appearance of harmless stupidity" and the doctors guessed his age at about forty. During the third night of his confinement, Slater had the first of his "attacks". He burst out from an uneasy sleep and into a frenzy which was so violent that it took four orderlies to restrain and strait-jacket him. For nearly fifteen minutes he gave vent to an incredible rant. The words were in the voice and couched in the paltry vocabulary of Slater but the onlookers could construe from the inadequate language a vision of:
 
green edifices of light, oceans of space, strange music, and shadowy mountains and valleys. But most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him. This vast, vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire. In order to reach it... he would soar through abysses of emptiness 'burning' every obstacle that stood in his way.
 
The ranting stopped as suddenly as it had started. This was the first of what would become nightly "attacks" of a similar nature. The peripheral otherworldly images of Slater's visions were different and more fantastic with each successive night, but always there was the central theme of the blazing entity and its revenge. The doctors were perplexed with Slater's case. Where did a backward man like Slater get such visions, when surely an illiterate rustic like him would have had little if any exposure to fairy tales or fantasy stories? Not that there were stories similar to Slater's. Why, too, was Slater dying?
 
As an undergraduate, the intern had built a device for two-way telepathic communication which he had tested with a fellow student with no result. The device was designed around his principle that thought was ultimately a form of radiant energy. Heedless of any ethics, he attached himself with Slater to the device as Slater lay near death. With the device switched on, he received a message from a light being whose experiences had been what were transmitted through Slater's medium. This being explained that, when not shackled to their physical bodies, all humans are light beings. The thought-message went on to explain that, as light beings within the realm of sleep, humans can experience the vistas of many planes and universes which remain unknown to waking awareness.
