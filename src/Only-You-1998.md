The window lock shouldn't lock out the master control on the driver's door, right? Although the lock button is pretty loose, and does not have a positive click into position.

It's been a while since I had my 96, but I was pretty sure that the master control locked out all controls, and I couldn't roll the windows up or down at all when activated using any of the controls. Just a guess, but it sounds like your lock switch is bad. Mine was a pretty firm click when it was activated or deactivated.
 
That was one of the few items that I could always find pretty readily at my local pull and pay junkyard. I wouldn't recommend eBay or anything like that since you can't inspect the switches first and may end up with the same issue, or worse.
 
Forever Love is a poignant made for television movie about a woman who awakens from a 20-year-long coma and begins her life all over again. In the drama, suggested by a true story, Lizzie and Alex Brooks are a fairy tale young couple, wildly in love and the parents of a little girl, Emma. Then, without warning, 24-year-old Lizzie suffers a stoke. At the hospital, doctors tell Alex that his young wife has slipped into a deep coma and there is nothing to do but wait to see if she comes out of it. Alex, determined to keep his vow to love Lizzie in sickness and in health, decides to bring her home and take care of her. Alex is helped and consoled by Gail, Lizzie's best friend. Gail not only offers a loving friendship to Alex, she fills in for Lizzie with young Emma as well. When Gail's husband is killed in a car crash, Alex, Gail and Emma form a de facto family unit of their own until, 20 years after her stroke, Lizzie wakes up. Miraculously, Lizzie is pronounced perfectly healthy and begins to try to assimilate back into a world that has radically changed. Emma, who is about to be married, is thrilled to have her mother back, as are Alex and Gail. But, Lizzie's presence is also confusing for all of them as she attempts to move back into the place she rightfully occupies in their lives. It's a journey of challenge and discovery for all of them as they grow, change, and begin to embrace each other again.

In 1998, U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter resigned in protest and accused the international community of not giving him and his colleagues the support they needed to carry out their job in Iraq, which had agreed in 1991 to destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. He was called to testify before the Senate in September 1998, where Biden, who was then the highest-ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations committee, grilled him. In the course of the questions, Biden made revealing remarks about where he stood on regime change in Iraq.
 
Biden was also aware of the difficulty of invading and occupying Iraq, unlike some of his Republican colleagues. In February 1998, the News Journal of Wilmington reported that Biden saw invasion as unlikely.
 
Though some Republicans have urged the military to remove Saddam from power entirely, Biden said there was little will for that in Congress. Such a move would require a bloody ground war, the use of 300,000 to 500,000 ground troops, and some kind of continuing presence in Iraq while a new government is installed, he said.
 
In the year 1988, the Rolex GMT-Master 16700 was introduced. This model is the successor of the GMT-Master 16750. The reference 16700 is the first GMT equipped with sapphire crystal and the hour markers surrounded with white gold. Under the slim 40mm steel case you will find the 3175 calibre which includes a quick-set date function, with no GMT quick-set yet. The Rolex GMT-Master 16700 was in production until the year 1999.
 
This Rolex GMT-Master reference 16700 dates from the year 1998 and features the 'Swiss only' dial. In the period of 1998 and 1999, Rolex switched from dials filled with Tritium to dials with 'Luminova'. The text at the bottom of the dial was changed to 'Swiss' only for one year. After this period, Rolex switched to 'Super Luminova' and the text at the bottom of the dial was changed to 'Swiss Made'. The 40mm case is in beautiful condition with sharp lugs. The oyster bracelet shows minimal stretch for its age. The red/blue aluminium Pepsi bezel has faded to a beautiful light red/pink colour over the years. This was common on watches that were exposed to a lot of sunlight in warm countries. According to the papers, this watch originates from Honolulu (Hawaii). So there is certainly no arguing about the taste of the previous owner! This beautiful vintage GMT-master comes with outer box, box, papers, calendar, translation booklet, GMT-Master booklet and hangtags.
 
The first Rolex GMT-Master was introduced in 1954 under the reference 6542. The watch was housed in a classic steel Oyster case of 38 mm. The GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) function is a useful tool for pilots and those who have traveled extensively over different continents. The ability to track local and home time was especially useful for commercial pilots. The American airline Pan America Airlines (Pan Am) approached Rolex and asked them to develop a watch for pilots. This led to the development of the 6542. The iconic red-and-blue bezel made its debut on the 6542, known to collectors as the pepsi.
 
I'm stumped and have run this problem by a half dozen mechanics who usually give me the expensive answer. I've got a GMC 1998 Suburban K1500 5.7 with 250,000 miles. It only starts with starter fluid now and then idles fine, maybe a bit rough, but purrs right along. So I replaced the fuel pump relay and the fuel filter but that didn't help. Then I had a mechanic replace the fuel pump and that fixed the problem. Started right up, all was good and well for a few hundred miles until it reverted back to its old self, not starting without starter fluid. (He never flushed the tanks to wash out any dirt or debris, I don't recall).
 
As the pump was under warranty the mechanic replaced that pump and all was well again, fired right up and I was happy, for a few hundred miles when it happened once more. It's taking longer to start now even with the starter fluid.
 
So, my fuel pressure gauge test measured the following. Key on, key off 50 psi where it held steady (It should be 60 - 62). At an idle it ran at 52 psi. I turned it off and pressure dropped to 48 where it held solid for 10 minutes.
 
From what I've read, because pressure held steady at 48 psi after I turned it off the problem isn't a leaky spider fuel injector or a leaky fuel pressure regulator under the intake manifold - and a real pain to get to. Am I right? Or, can the pressure regulator be causing problems even if it does not leak? And how would I know? Is leakage the only problem that can arise with the regulator? With two brand new fuel pumps I find it unlikely that's the problem, but what else could it be? And, if it was the spider injector or pressure regulator leaking I would think it still wouldn't have started up even with those new fuel pumps. Opinions run the course. And what are the odds of two new fuel pumps being bad right out of the box?
 
Maybe there's a clogged fuel line? Some obstruction? One fellow told me he had the same problem with a small piece of paper towel caught in the line. Now, here's a clue. I've driven this rig thousands and thousands of miles on dusty dirt roads in the Southwest deserts and off-road in the Rockies. Is it possible that dirt or dust or gunk is in the tank that is blocking something? I know clogged fuel filters and this isn't it. In my experience the truck usually sputters and bumps along if the filter is really clogged, but not this rig. And, I had the filter changed.
 
Or, is there a valve of some kind in the line that might be stuck open or shut? I have no idea, but I don't want the mechanic to throw parts at it randomly, like replacing the spider injectors or the pressure regulator, expensive as that is. Any ideas? Thanks.
 
. have you checkedthe fuel flow? not just the pressure which is a little low but it should still start. a good fuel pressure gauge has a dump valve on it, with the truck running you should be able to open the dump valve and it should stay running if the pumps doing its job. it wouldn't be the first time they have shipped a whole batch of defective pumps. if they do change the pump again have them blow out the lines between the pump and the filter just to make sure theres no debris in that line. unlikely theres muck in the tank unless you run without a gas cap. was it doing this before you changed the filter? if so its unlikely theres anything in the line from the filter to the engine unless the filter was so old that the insides disintegrated. any water in the filter when you changed it? are you changing the fuel pump module or just the pump?
