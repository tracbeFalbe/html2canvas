I have not done this specific journey myself so I cannot comment on it exactly. However, and this may be a dumb question, but did you actually take the thick hide out of the tanner? The reason I ask this is because some of the other journeys, such as cooking, do not update until you take the item you crafted out of the place you were instructed to craft it in, even though the step does not indicate that you have to do so. If you have, then I do not know.

Hi Reconfx. You can always try to run a hidden SL/TP script and see if it works for you. Avoid SL at classic stop hunting levels as for example 00-20-80 cos this is where the retail herd put their SLs most of the time.
 
Actually i have observed that if your expert is profitable then broker know that you are trading by experts,they have an option in thei back office where they know which accounts are trading by experts and which are trading Manually.

Maybe this is a technical problem and should not be hidden from your broker, we should lay this to them. This is just one other reason why i feel comfortable with Profiforex, they are always ready to help and to calm your nerves. Why not speak with your broker?
 
Brokers and market makers hunt the SL mostly though the night (Asian session) when they are bored. It is paradox that everybody says that Asian session has not enough volatility to trade but there are the longest candles or gaps created! That's the artificial micro trading of the mighty corporations!
 
Basically, you want to only see the red labels in Bitdefender's Email Protection feature in Gmail, not the green ones. But, Bitdefender automatically labels emails as safe (green) or dangerous (red). Unfortunately, there's no direct way to hide the green labels permanently in Bitdefender's settings. The green labels are meant mainly for web browsers and might look different in email apps.
 
With Amazon Prime Video, I received a similar message each time I tried to click on a video. It told me my VPN was detected. This happens often during testing because Amazon Prime Video is one of the hardest platforms to access.
 
However, there are great VPNs that make it easy to watch all these services from anywhere. If you want to stay safe while streaming every major platform, check out this list of the best VPNs for streaming.
 
**Hide Expert has a bare bones network of 29 servers that does nothing to stand out.** There are no city-level locations, and there are no specialty servers. The top VPNs all have much larger server lists that allow you to pick which city you want to connect to in several countries. Most also offer servers optimized for different activities (like torrenting or streaming).
 
**The only security feature Hide Expert tells its customers about is the IKEv2 protocol.** A protocol is a set of rules a VPN follows to funnel your traffic through its servers. It also helps determine how the VPN will encrypt your information. Each protocol comes with different pros and cons.
 
**IKEv2 is effective for mobile devices due to its ability to promptly restore connections.** This is particularly beneficial for phones as they frequently switch between WiFi and mobile networks. However, I would prefer if Hide Expert provided additional options. For instance, OpenVPN is an extremely secure protocol, and WireGuard is designed for enhanced speed.
 
The top VPNs give you many more options when it comes to protocols, as well as many other security features. To get a VPN that comes with a kill switch, multiple protocols, and more, you can try one of the safest VPNs available from this list.
 
Many VPNs have been banned by the Chinese government. Thankfully, it usually only goes after the technology, rather than getting individuals in trouble for using them. I recommend you read up on Chinese laws before choosing to use a VPN in the country. To find a VPN that can get past the Great Firewall, look at this list of VPNs that work in China.
 
Even with the longest subscription term, Hide Expert is too expensive for its limited offering**.** For example, you can get a yearly subscription to IPVanish for a similar price. That VPN is compatible with Windows, comes with a kill switch, has a huge server network, and much more.
 
**I do like that the 3-day trial comes with no restrictions.** You get this automatically when you install the VPN. There are no data limits, and you can use every server. The only catch is you have to pay after the trial is up to continue using it.
 
**Hide Expert has a long way to go before competing with the top VPNs.** There is no way to contact support. The website only provides a few details about its service, probably because the VPN is limited.
 
**Yes, Hide Expert will slow you down on every server.** Every VPN will reduce your speeds at least a little because your traffic has to be rerouted. However, Hide Expert lowered my speeds twice as much as the top VPNs. Plus, most VPNs are faster on nearby servers, but Hide Expert dropped my speeds significantly at any distance.

Some of my ships are unhindered by the Expert Systems icon. Like my Burst shows Mastery II. My Navitas shows Mastery I. Do i have to train ALL the skills that the expert systems represent to make the icon disappear??
 
If this is not a bug, this seem like a Quality of Life issue. Players should be able to toggle off the Expert Systems icon on the Ship Tree, so that their Master information displays properly. I have a bunch of skills completing over night, and it would be nice to be able to view my progress without this icon hindering my view. And right clicking every ship to see where I am at in mastery is very cumbersome.
 
Though Mastery is not 100% accurate per ship, and the system definitely needs a pass and revamp, I would guestimate that Mastery skills are on average about 85% accurate to the effective flying of your ship.
 
As you can probably tell, we had to reach to find the differences between these two lines of gloves. Most of the differences that exist are going to be the inherent and minute details that simply come from the two gloves being made by different companies.
 
Wilson is more coy in how they market the leather for their A2000s. They call their A2000 material Pro Stock Leather. Its characteristics are similar to what is seen on Heart of the Hides. Due to that, we would infer that steerhide is mostly being used to make A2000s.
 
As mentioned above, both materials are stiff in their feel. And due to that, you can expect to invest extra effort to get the gloves broken into a game-ready feel (i.e. a few weeks of using the glove consistently). However, both Rawlings and Wilson offer select models of their signature lines that should come with easier break-ins. The Heart of the Hides will have their R2G models which receive extra softening in the factory and also have a thinned out heel pad that should require only 35% of the break-in to be done by the player (Rawlings says a regular Heart of the Hide will require 60% of the break-in to be done by the player). Wilson also offers a remedy to the longer break-in and that is their SuperSkin material that was mentioned previously. Not only does SuperSkin provide lightweight benefits, but it also makes a glove easier to break in.

Unfortunately, iPhone users could potentially detect your AirTag, defeating the reason you hide them in valuables. When AirTags try to connect to the Find My network, nearby iPhones might alert their owners.
 
Imagine this happening when someone with an iPhone steals your car. When they get an alert, they will know you have a tracker in the vehicle. In response, they might turn off their smartphones to avoid detection or stop to find and destroy the AirTag.
 
GPS-enabled units give you a more reliable way to track items no matter where they go. A GPS tracker like the LandAirSea 54 uses a global network of satellites and ground stations to triangulate locations accurately. The technology works practically anywhere, so you can always locate missing items, even in areas with low population density.
 
The Silvercloud app that comes with LAS devices makes it easy for you to create geographic boundaries. When you draw boundaries on the app, Silvercloud will notify you when your GPS tracker crosses a line. That gives you a more proactive way to protect your assets. For example, if someone takes a company vehicle without permission, you could get a text message that lets you know to contact law enforcement immediately. The sooner you reach out to the police, the more likely they can recover your stolen asset.
 
It helps that your iPhone lets you know when the battery is close to running out of power. Unfortunately, you still need to access the AirTag to change the battery. What happens when the battery dies while you search for a missing item?
 
Additionally, you may notice that the expert screen looks SUPER BUSY with all the buildings. But the additional building displays and lines can be turned off with the 5 icons in the lower right, allowing the user to focus on as much or as little as possible.
 
The difference in interface meant that beginners never saw or got to use some of the more advanced features of the game, and instead focused on the few
