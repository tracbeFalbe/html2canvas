The first method used to calculate the operation section is called the **direct method**, which is based on the transactional information that impacted cash during the period. To calculate the operation section using the direct method, take all cash collections from operating activities, and subtract all of the cash disbursements from the operating activities.
 
Instead of organizing transactional data like the direct method, the accountant starts with the net income number found from the income statement and makes adjustments to undo the impact of the accruals that were made during the period.

Essentially, the accountant will convert net income to actual cash flow by de-accruing it through a process of identifying any non-cash expenses for the period from the income statement. The most common and consistent of these are **depreciation**, the reduction in the value of an asset over time, and **amortization**, the spreading of payments over multiple periods.
 
Whenever you review any financial statement, you should consider it from a business perspective. Financial documents are designed to provide insight into the financial health and status of an organization.
 
**Positive cash flow** indicates that a company has more money flowing into the business than out of it over a specified period. This is an ideal situation to be in because having an excess of cash allows the company to reinvest in itself and its shareholders, settle debt payments, and find new ways to grow the business.
 
Positive cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however. Your business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and you can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.
 
Cash flow statements are one of the most critical financial documents that an organization prepares, offering valuable insight into the health of the business. By learning how to read a cash flow statement and other financial documents, you can acquire the financial accounting skills needed to make smarter business and investment decisions, regardless of your position.

The first step in preparing a cash flow statement is determining the starting balance of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the reporting period. This value can be found on the income statement of the same accounting period.
 
After calculating cash flows from operating activities, you need to calculate cash flows from investing activities. This section of the cash flow statement details cash flows related to the buying and selling of long-term assets like property, facilities, and equipment. Keep in mind that this section only includes investing activities involving free cash, not debt.
 
When using GAAP, this section also includes dividends paid, which may be included in the operating section when using IFRS standards. Interest paid is included in the operating section under GAAP but sometimes in the financing section under IFRS.
 
The change in net cash for the period is equal to the sum of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities. This value shows the total amount of cash a company gained or lost during the reporting period. A positive net cash flow indicates a company had more cash flowing into it than out of it, while a negative net cash flow indicates it spent more than it earned.
 
This cash flow statement is for a reporting period that ended on Sept. 28, 2019. As you'll notice at the top of the statement, the opening balance of cash and cash equivalents was approximately $10.7 billion.
 
During the reporting period, operating activities generated a total of $53.7 billion. The investing activities section shows that the business used a total of $33.8 billion in transactions related to investments. The financing activities section shows that a total of $16.3 billion was spent on activities related to debt and equity financing.
 
At the bottom of the cash flow statement, the three sections are summed to total a $3.5 billion increase in cash and cash equivalents over the course of the reporting period. Therefore, the final balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year equals $14.3 billion.
 
The balance sheet and cash flow statement are fundamental tools in financial analysis. However, these documents serve distinct purposes and offer different insights into your organization's financial health.
 
A **balance sheet** provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time, detailing assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity. As a result, it offers an overview of what a company owns and owes. In contrast, a cash flow statement focuses specifically on the movement of cash within an organization over a reporting period, categorizing cash activities into operating, investing, and financing activities.
 
Understanding how to create, interpret, and effectively use financial statements is pivotal for strategic decision-making. Financial statements, particularly, are essential tools that extend beyond simple record-keeping that can guide your business strategy.
