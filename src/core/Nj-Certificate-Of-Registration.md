Please note that this certificate is not required for all businesses in New Jersey. It is required only for those doing business with the public sector and with the casino service industry.
 
You may check the online registration inquiry to determine if the business is already registered. If you have not registered but are required to have this certificate, you will need to complete Form NJ-REG.

When you go to the polls to vote, present one of the seven (7) acceptable forms of photo ID. If you do not possess an acceptable form of photo identification and cannot reasonably obtain one, you may present a supporting form of ID (one of which is your valid voter registration certificate) and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration (PDF), noting your reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of photo identification, stating that the information contained in the declaration is true, that you are the same individual personally appearing at the polling place to sign the declaration, and that you face a reasonable impediment to procuring an acceptable form of photo identification. An election official will match your name to the official list of registered voters.
 
For voters that applied for and received the permanent exemption from showing a photo ID based in their disability status, this status will be notated on their voter registration certificate. These voters are required to present their voter registration certificate when they go to the polls to vote.

Any affidavit or section 1-109 verification must be submitted along with the application for certificate of registration. The affidavit or section 1-109 verification is optional and it is up to the registering entity to determine if it is appropriate.

If a formal action is pending against any of the law firm's shareholders/members or partners, the law firm must submit a motion to the Court requesting permission to register or renew. The motion must provide the status of the pending disciplinary action. See below for more information regarding submitting a motion.
