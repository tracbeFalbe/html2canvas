Created in 2004, VALE helps airport sponsors meet their state-related air quality responsibilities under the Clean Air Act. Through VALE, airport sponsors can use Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds and Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs) to finance low emission vehicles, refueling and recharging stations, gate electrification, and other airport air quality improvements.

As of October 2023, VALE grants have funded 141 projects at 58 airports. Please note that there was a reduction in the number of airports participating in this program (49 Airports to 48 Airports) because some prior grants were cancelled at the request of the participants. The projects have been deleted from the list as well as their contributions to the emission reductions. Details of the remaining and new projects can be found in the project summary below. These VALE grants are expected to reduce ozone emissions by 1,768 tons per year for the next 5 years. This is equivalent to removing 98,700 cars and trucks off the road each year.
 
The annual deadline for pre-applications is November 1 each year. Airports must submit pre-applications to their FAA Airports District Office (or FAA Regional Office for Regions without ADOs) by that date. Pre-applications are plain bond write-ups of no more than 3 pages with the following information:
 
There are bands that have been acting ruthlessly in the shadow for years, in a completely confidential manner, then one day chance (but does chance exist ?) makes you find one of their recordings, listen to it, and at that moment you could kick yourself for not having discovered these soundscapes earlier and you try to find all of them. That is exactly what happened to me with In Aeternam Vale, a strange name that will surely remind you of nothing in particular, and that is really a shame. At the basis of this band, a guy named Laurent Prot, a kind of equivalent to what Frank Tovey represented in England or Dirk Ivens in Belgium, an electronics fanatic who experimented all the sounds that you can obtain from analogical synthesizers and rhythmn boxes.

Meandering northward through the middle of Andover, the Shawsheen River offers canoeists and walkers a chance to observe wildlife and water plants at close range. The river is shallow between Ballardvale dam and Abbot Bridge, but still canoeable in all except the driest times. Extensive cattail marshes make walking difficult along the east side of the river. However they provide excellent habitat for geese, ducks and occasional herons, muskrat and painted turtles. The AVIS reservations on the west side of the river offer fields, woodlands, and excellent views of the river.
