Explained simply, you can delete every program by using the uninstaller file. The installation process creates this file. In some cases, this file is not produced. This means that it will be impossible to uninstall it by using the Windows Add/Remove tool. In most cases, you will need to turn to 3rd party uninstaller products such as Revo Uninstaller Pro.

Revo Uninstaller Pro forced uninstall also helps in some cases when the product that you want to remove gets stuck halfway through its uninstallation. The same goes for when you attempt to install or reinstall a software product. Forced uninstall will solve the issue for you.
 
Most of the software that you are installing on your PC comes with its very own uninstaller. The location of this executable utility is in the installation folder of the program. This tool is an uninstallation wizard that is used to uninstall the software product from your computer. To use this method, follow these steps:

When you are using this method you need to be careful what registry keys you are deleting. If you are inexperienced there is a high chance that you can damage your system. That is why we recommend using 3rd-party applications such as Revo Uninstaller Pro that will safely guide you through the process.
 
The process of installation and removal of programs on Windows at times is not as seamless as it should be. There are times when certain programs cannot be deleted from the system and users are met with frustrating errors when attempting to do so.
 
This can happen due to a number of reasons such as disabled or corrupt Windows Installer service or problems within the operating system. In this guide, we will look at the five troubleshooting methods you can try if you cannot uninstall software in Windows.
 
Although it may sound like the Windows Installer service only pertains to the installation of programs on Windows, it also plays a vital role in the uninstallation process as well. If the Windows Installer service is either disabled or not working properly, you are likely to face issues while uninstalling applications from the system.
 
Since in most cases of uninstallation errors, the Windows Installer service is to blame, we will be starting our troubleshooting journey by restarting this service. If restarting does not work, then we will try re-registering Windows Installer and check if that makes a difference.
 
You can also try restarting the Windows Explorer process in the same window to fix the issue. Simply locate Windows Explorer and right-click on it. Choose **Restart** from the context menu and check if it makes a difference.
 
As we mentioned above, you can also face the issue under consideration when the app is running in the background and its process interferes with the uninstallation process. As it turns out, there can be other apps in your system interfering with the uninstallation process as well.
 
Since it is difficult to pinpoint the exact app that might be causing it on your operating system, we will be booting into Safe Mode to fix this issue. Safe Mode launches Windows will the most basic drivers and apps that are vital for it to run.
 
Finally, there is a chance that you are unable to uninstall the program because of an issue within the Registry. Ideally, the Registry keys associated with the program should automatically delete when you uninstall it.
 
If you no longer require a program on your system, you can remove it entirely to make space for newer and better alternatives. In case you face an issue during this process, the methods mentioned above should help you get back on track with the uninstallation in no time.
 
However, if you are still encountering the problem, you can either consider contacting Microsoft's official team and reporting the issue to them or installing a third-party uninstaller. Hopefully, this will help you uninstall the targeted program successfully.
 
First of all, just know that I did a lot of researches before, and I didn't find anything that works for me, so that's why I'm posting here. I recently uninstalled Arduino in order to reinstall (because I think that I forgot to check some boxes or something, but well it's not important anymore). But unfortunately, I can't reinstall Arduino...
 
My computer is under Windows 10, and when I go to Settings -> Applications, there is still "Arduino" here (and that's strange because I deleted everything, I even did a defragmentation, etc...), and when I click on it and select "Uninstall", it shows :
 
So it looks like I really uninstalled Arduino (even if there is still "Arduino" in my applications...) but when I download it again on the official website, when I launch it, and new message appears that says :
 
So basically it says that I can't install Arduino because I have to uninstall it first, but when I got to my Settings and Applications and I select "Uninstall" for Arduino, it says that the uninstallation file is missing...
 
Thank you for your time (by the way, sorry for my english, I tried to do my best, I translated the first error message so it's maybe not 100% accurate, but the 2nd error message appears in english on my computer so that's just a copy and paste) !
 
A workaround would be to use the "Windows ZIP file for non admin install" download from That version doesn't require installation. You just unzip the downloaded file and you're ready to use the Arduino IDE. You can move the unzipped folder to any convenient location you prefer.
 
I have windows 10, I downloaded Arduino 1.8.5 IDE, it some how got a bug or something. It says I need Administrator permission to open this file. I am the only Administrator on this machine. I have clicked on the file for Arduino and clicked on security to allow "everyone" permission for this file and I still can't delete it. I have gone to every point I can think of and deleted anything Arduino related but the documents file still remains and won't let me delete ir without Admin permission.
I need help !!!
 
The file was downloaded from the Arduino site from the non-administrator download. I am able to download and once downloaded I can Delete that file no issues just this particular one Arduino 1.8.5 windows
 
When I click on the Downloaded Arduino 1.8.5 windows and open it it has a bunch of sub folders like hardware, tools, avr. No exe or any program files. Clicking on each one of these folders opens another
folder etc.

McAfee is also known to have issues with Arduino software simply because of the nature of what it does.
It has been seen a few times to stop proper operation and you would need to add the Arduino folders to McAfee's exclusions / whitelist.
 
I've been trying for the last several days to run Dell SupportAssist (version 3.13.2.14) on my Vostro 15-7500 laptop. All I ever get is the message, "This is taking longer than expected. We recommend restarting your PC and trying again later." This hasn't worked in the last several days.
 
If I run the installation file, SupportAssistLauncher.exe, I get the message that the latest version of SupportAssist is already installed. If I try to uninstall the program, I get a Windows Installer error, "The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable. Click OK to try again, or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package 'SupportAssistx64-3.13.2.14.msi' in the box below." The path to this file is:
 
"And then a miracle occurred . . . ." Well, not exactly. SupportAssist still doesn't work, so I've decided to wait for the next release and hope that will fix the reinstall problem. But that was only the tip of the iceberg of my Windows woes. So many other things had gone flakey (my backup program, Acronis Cyber Protect Home and Office, wasn't working properly; if I right-clicked on a drive in File Explorer, File Explorer closed; Windows detected two brand new SanDisk flash drives I recently purchased, but wouldn't display them in File Explorer; Windows said there were no restore points saved), I was all set to do a factory reset of Windows. I tried to download the Dell OS Recovery tool on my Dell laptop, and nothing appeared to be happening (via WiFi; the laptop doesn't have a port for a network cable (grrrr!)), so I downloaded it to an older Toshiba that does have a network port.
 
To cut this long story short, I installed the recovery tool and system image to the one flash drive I have that Windows would recognize on the Dell laptop, and ran it. I followed the recommended sequence of tasks, and it offered me a restore point that Windows claimed didn't exist. I took it, and most of the flakiness (except for SupportAssist not running properly) seems to be gone, without my having to do a complete reset. Scannow found and fixed a few issues that it failed to find previously. File Explorer even recognizes the SanDisk flash drives now!
 
I'm marking this "Accept as Solution" because there are so many valuable points made, but it's really only a partial solution since the original problem with SupportAssist remains. Dell still needs to do better.
 
You might want to try the Microsoft Install/Uninstall Troubleshooter to see if it can uninstall SupportAssist. See Method V of the Dell support article Windows 11, and Windows 10: Various Methods to Uninstall Problematic Programs an
