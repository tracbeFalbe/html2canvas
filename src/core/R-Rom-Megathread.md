No-Intro and Redump are groups that catalog hashes of dumped games for different systems. If a link has "No-Intro" or "Redump" in the name, it is a collection of the currently best-available ROMs for the system. These should be your go-to links if what you are looking for is not in the Popular Games page.
 
Internet Archive items will have metadata files that end in extensions such as .xml and .sqlite. These files are not important to download but are meant for the website to know what files to display and the reviews of the item.
 
Some Internet Archive items will contain torrent files to provide another download method. However, the torrent's files listing is usually incomplete compared to what is listed on the website. For this reason, it is recommended to use direct downloads with a download manager instead of torrents.

These files are not ROMs themselves; to use them, you must extract them. 7-Zip is recommended for extracting these files. Download and install it here and run it. Then, open the archive file in 7-Zip or right click on it and go to 7-Zip -> Extract Files.
 
While not required anymore due to megaup links being removed, uBlock Origin is recommended when accessing certain links on this megathread and the Internet in general. It blocks ads, trackers,and much more.
 
MEGA and 1Fichier have pretty serious data caps and unlike Google Drive, there is no easy way to get around them. To bypass the MEGA and 1Fichier download limits, you will need either a VPN or a list of proxies. For the VPN, connect to it and you are good to go. For a list of proxies, you will have to use some 3rd party tool like JDownloader2 and give it the list of proxies. Do note that this process is fairly advanced. After that, you can start downloading by feeding JDownloader2 links to the files you would like to download.
