It might be interesting to add a place to copy and paste links that can go in Book Details based on the template set in the settings for this plugin. Automatic page properties would be a cool addition in the future as well, especially if they can pull data from custom columns
 
Hello! Thank you for creating this! I am trying to use the plugin but everytime I do i get an error that logseq cannot connect to calibre API and to make sure the content server is on. My content server is on, and when I change the content server link as suggested, i still get the same error or a simple fail error. What am I doing wrong?

OK. Great. But having never used Logseq, and all I want to do is take notes as I read a book, I cannot figure out how to open an epub book in Logseq. I installed the 2 plugins for Logseq and started the calibre server, but the behavior of Logseq does not look like it does in your GIFs/videos. Please advise.
 
My regular workflow with pdfs is to annotate them (highlights app, PDF expert or DT) and then export / summarise the highlights or notes to DT where I reorganize them joining my ideas and research notes (aka reading notes).
 
To export your annotations: in any Kindle app (they all have the same interface on whatever platform or device, thanks to the switch-over to React native) show your annotations with the following icon.
 
Before Amazon opened Kindle to side-loaded (or in this case up-loaded) epubs, I had the same problem as you, cursing Apple for trapping annotations made in Books in a SQLite database with no easy way to export.
 
Hi - I annotated an Epub book, 'the mermaid,' and did around 50 pages and closed it. I renamed the book to 'The Mermaid', and capitalized the first letters before reopening it, continued annotating another 200 pages, and closed it.
 
I just highlighted in yellow, a short passage in an EPUB opened in Apple's Books application on Monterey 12.5.1. As there are no save controls, I clicked the document's red traffic light on the title bar, in hopes that the close operation was also a save. When I reopened the EPUB, the yellow highlight was still present.

After making the 200 pages of annotations, I quit the EPUB (CMD+Q). When I reopened it, all those 200 pages of annotations were gone. Is there any way I can retrieve those annotations, if they were stored somewhere?
 
By quitting Apple Books and not clicking the red traffic light button, you by-passed the inherent save operation and those 200 pages of annotations, if that quanta of annotations is supported, are now lost with no recovery possible.
 
In Windows 10 Creators Update, the Edge browser got the ability to open EPUB books. This change was welcomed by many users. The EPUB format is very popular and widely used. Starting with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Edge supports annotations for EPUB. Let's see how to use this feature.

 
Microsoft Edge recently received a new feature that will definitely make it more appealing to users. The latest Windows 10 build brings EPUB file format support to Edge, allowing users to read their favorite EPUB books directly in the browser.

As an elegant digital note-taking tablet, Supernote offers a distraction-free and immersive reading experience by allowing users to read EPUB/PDF books or documents effectively with the help of contents, bookmarks and annotations.
 
**Contents**, also known as **table of contents**, provide an overview of the document divided in chapters, as well as an easy way to quickly jump to a specific section in the document.
 
The ability to mark up an EPUB/PDF document with great ease helps create a enjoyable and effective reading experience. It also makes collaboration so much easier as it allows you to provide feedback directly on the document.
 
If you don't need to delete all the annotations on a page, you can use the **Regular Eraser** and **Region Eraser**on the toolbar****to erase the annotations you wish to delete. Or you can use the **Erase All** button on the toolbar to erase all the annotations on the page at once.
 
NOTES  
currently highlights CANNOT BE MOVED you need to replace (and delete the original). Color and other appearances can be changed.  
Objects such as Carets, Comments, Stamps etc. can be moved by dragging.  
Free text is currently not free-form to alter size so for now simply set the boundary to 0
 
Remember for PDF files up to 32 MB you can edit the same file/page in both Edge and SumatraPDF at the same time.  
After a change in SumatraPDF you need to save annotation and in Edge you wil ALSO need to hit reload/refresh, However when you **SAVE file changes e.g. after inking in Edge** there is no need to hit refresh in SumatraPDF it will appear instantly.
 
It WAS possible in past pre-releases (and was usable/useful for txt chm and mobi / epub / ebooks in fixed interface) and for a while there were two systems, so full release 3.2 can still work with those .smx files, thus possible to hand (text-program) write your own.
 
However that historic method was removed after 3.3.13011 as the newer PDF annotation methods increasingly conflicted.  
It is possible to find older pre-release copies lurking with the ability to add highlights to mobi / epub but deletion was notoriously buggy, thus often for changes, involved resorting back to adjusting values in a text editor.
 
If you want to see how it worked and have 3.2 (portable will do) rename any epub file to Any.epub  
Save the following text in the same folder as Any.epub.smx (that is the same filename with.smx which roughly=SumatrapdfMetaXtension)
 
It can seem slow to start but you find shortcuts like guess the rough position save in notepad with Ctrl S then refocus SumatraPDF and press R to reload that edit then skip on to the next there is no need for those decimals so  
rect = 126 96 240 50  
should work just as well
 
Another trick to reduce the mental math is to work in inches and ignore the decimals as 1.00 inches considered as 100 is close to the 96 dpi value needed  
So for the screen position of uper highlight I can mentally round down a few percent
 
The file is not editing the ebook as it simply adds a companion file and for adding notes / comments per page in a seperate companion file I have elsewhere in the forum shown ways to do that (most easily with MS write / WordPad)
 
Starting immediately, iOS and Android phones and tablets can be used for annotations or to highlight sections in PDFs and EPubs. All annotation and highlight data syncs automatically between players on all platforms.

Reasons for this: I store all my epubs in Dropbox and read and annotate them on several computers. When I annotated a file on one of them I want to see the same on any other computer. I don't want to be locked in by using a specific epub cloud service because in the past I annotated tens of ebooks using an iPad Kindle app and lost all of them and don't want to experience the same again
 
Bluefire and Adobe Digital Editions have it. Bluefire's annotation is better since you can export a neat (organized) set of notes and highlights; both of them have their issues however and Bluefire for Windows is no longer in development. I'm still looking for something which bridges the gap, so do let me know if you find it.
 
Hi. Your current process with PDFs just relies on the fact that an Evernote attachment can be opened by any suitable editor, and the amended version saved back to the note. No special 'integration' required. If you can find some specialist epub software with an editor that allows you to highlight text and save back to an epub file, that should be enough. Some web searching and research required though, I think - please let us know if you find a good epub editor.
 
You could also look into whether highlights transfer when an edited PDF file is converted to an epub file. Calibre is certainly capable of converting the epub file to PDF and back. It also has some epub editing features. Calibre has an inbuilt library folder, but it also edits epubs. It could be useful to try it out.
 
It would be (IMHO) highly unlikely for Evernote to want to be directly involved in any of this unless there are a lot of users desperate for something similar. You could post in the section below to see if there is any support for the suggestion...
General Feature Requests
 
Just did a bit more research, it seems that epub files don't support any annotation functionality within themselves. Its the e-reader software that creates that ability, but the annotations never get stored in-file. Which means that, at least for now, I'll have to content myself with exporting highlights as an external file and plonking those into Evernote.
 
Or converting the epub files to PDF... but then I'll run into another issue, which is whether annotated PDFs will automatically be saved back into Evernote when I'm on a tablet. I'll probably have to manually reupload the changed file every time I'm done reading.
 
Phew! But nah, I won't make a feature request to Evernote as I'm sure they'll just ignore it. If its taken 7 years of people wanting different highlighter colours and its still not happened, then I doubt they'll add epub reading capabiliti
