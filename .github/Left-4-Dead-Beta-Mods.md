The mod is made on the theme of zombie apocalypse and on some maps can be similar to Left 4 Dead or Resident Evil (+ if you set the appropriate settings for the atmosphere of level change), for single-player mod is quite difficult, and immediately shows you that to survive alone in the apocalypse - you need to be almost a god of war. So far, 1.5 comes out in open beta and this version of the mod is a global update, if all versions before 1.5 had the look of the mod for vanilla and had only 4 types of enemies, + poor optimization, now it's the opposite, the mod is not vanilla-looking, optimization has become a little better and new classes of enemies should expand to replacing all classes in the doom.(at the moment 15 classes from the doom replaced, 21 classes exist in the mod and used)

 
My absolute favorite thing in the world is when games existences somehow mirror their names. Seriously. I have very few other interests. I'm an incredibly boring person. But anyway, just as Duke Nukem Forever took forever to come out, Call of Duty is nothing if not dutiful in its adherence to a yearly release schedule, and Toilet Tycoon was awful, Left 4 Dead 2 has not, in fact, been left for dead. Sure, Valve hasn't lavished it with quite as much attention as, say, Team Fortress 2, but it's certainly attempted to empower the community's efforts - first with Cold Stream, and then with full Workshop support. But those mods? They're about to get seventy five point blue banana apple sauce percent modderier, because Valve's put its Extended Mutation System into beta.

"What is EMS? It is vastly improved scripting system that allows script authors to go past modifying existing scripts and write custom script logic, spawn and control entities, and much much more. Mod authors will now be able to create deep custom experiences that can be played on any map or tailor create something for new or existing maps."
 
A handy wiki, meanwhile, further explains the ins-and-outs of all of the above and also directing the Director. Unfortunately, it offers no advice on how to avoid the unsettling existential questions that you're sure to encounter as a result. Basically, though, here's the big takeaway: "The Extended Mutation System is now flexible enough to support the creation of Mutations that rival all-new game modes in complexity."
 
Neato, huh? For now, though, the EMS is only just beginning to stir in its beta crypt, as Valve's hoping to both squash bugs and add new features before releasing in full. Happily, in a gesture of (potentially prophetic) kindness, Craig put together this nice list of preexisting mods to tide you over. And hey, there are already velociraptors and lightsabers. The future of L4D2 modding is bright indeed.
 
So far I've only put on some EE bark busters and an EE tall and soft seat. I need to cut the bars down still. I'm using mine for TN woods riding only and I'm new to this type of riding so taking my time with upgrades. Love this bike! So much fun! It's such a goat just point it and go. I do have a Scott dampner on the shelf need to buy the mount. Here she is
 
I am an old dirtbike rider, 68 years old, who has jumped ship from a long list of KTM dirtbikes I have owned and rode thousands upon thousands of single track miles in the last 20 years. This is my first Beta. The reason I jumped from KTM to the Beta Xtrainer was the size of the Xtrainer fits me much better than the KTM. I now have 66 hours on my Xtrainer and I am very satisfied with the bike. No regrets.

2. Twisted Engineering Handlebars and hand guards. I bought these because I have to have something to cushion my old hands and wrists and shoulders from trail shock and the light weight they offer compared to Flexbars that I have used in the past. This was a mistake for me. The TE bars are lighter weight by far than the Flexbars but don't offer the shock absorbing action that the Flexbars do on rough rocky, rooty trail that my Flexbars of past years have.
 
6. Heavier springs front and rear. I ordered these springs early on when Beta first came out with their recommended spring size per your weight and wound up with springs that are still to light as some here , Moto9, have tested and found that you need to go up 2 or 3 sizes.
 
Is it possible to get an XT and not make any mods apart from bash plate,I mean people are doing lots of mods..My other bikes I've only ever fitted a bash plate and wide foot pegs...Does the XT really need a lot to fix it up..
 
Thanks.Yes the kickstand is handy and the suspension I'd need to sort I'm 95kg with kit.Would you say the 250rr would be less intimidating than the 300 exc,I do like to hammer.I had a 2010 300 exc but struggled with it but I'm willing to try again now am better rider.
 
2. Seat concepts low seat
3. EarthX battery

5. Clake two, removed foot brake & rerouted brake light wire & added a different hydraulic brake switch to Clake since OEM nissin one didn't fit
 
18. Turn signals (Rears mounted on beta wedges), flasher

20. Bullet Proof Designs Sharkfin Rear Disc Guard 
21. Bullet Proof Designs X-Trainer Radiator Guards
22. Moose case saver with OEM sprocket cover cut to fit
 
BETA Start/Kill Switch - "Unclutter your bars with the Beta over under start/kill switch. This switch is the same as the stock start button. A 'plug and ride' switch that requires no splicing. Kill button is the non-lock down version. Works great with the 26-038 Head Light Control Switch or the 26-046 Multi-Function Bar Switch to get rid of the gigantic stock light control switch."
 
If you enjoy playing old Minecraft, like I do, you might know that Beta 1.7.3 is one of the most popular versions of old Minecraft. Why? Because it was the last version before the absolutely enormous Beta 1.8 came out. Beta 1.8 added lots of features that make Minecraft what it is today, like mineshafts, creative mode, strongholds, hunger, and a completely overhauled world generator.
 
However, since pre-Beta 1.8 versions will no longer be updated, this left those who enjoyed and regularly play those versions deal with an absolute barrage of bugs, unwanted features, and missing features. For example, the lack of creative mode before Beta 1.8 made it hard to actually unleash your imagination and build something exactly as you wanted, which is supposed to be the whole point of Minecraft! There's also a couple of features hated by the community, such as the almost 100% chance of a zombie/skeleton spawning when you try to sleep, or food not stacking at all.
 
BetterBeta aims to fix those bugs, add the missing features, remove the unwanted, and improve the quality of life without making it incompatible with regular Beta 1.7.3 or taking away the Beta feeling. In a way, BetterBeta is an addon to Beta 1.7.3.
 
Note: The zip file is NOT a MultiMC Instance!
MultiMC: Select the Minecraft version as b1.7.3, then click on "Add to Minecraft.jar" and select the BetterBeta zip file. Note: The BetterBeta zip file is NOT a MultiMC Instance!
Betacraft Launcher: You can get the mod from the Mods Repository. Sound not working? Try running regular b1.7.3, waiting for a bit until the sounds download, and then switch back to betterbeta
JAR File Modify: Use a zip extractor to open the betterbeta zip file and the b1.7.3 jar file, and drag all the files of the betterbeta zip to b1.7.3.jar, and delete the "META-INF" folder

 
The history of BetterBeta starts in... wait, no... the IDEA of BetterBeta started all the way back in November 2021, where I started working on the predecessor of this mod, Continued Beta, which was a mod that had a simple goal: to add new features, blocks, and items as if Notch never decided to work on the Adventure Update (Beta 1.8). Continued Beta was never compatible with regular Beta 1.7.3, but there was one part of its foundation that is also seen in BetterBeta: to fix the many bugs of Beta 1.7.3.
 
However, one month into Continued Beta's development, a bizzare bug emerged where the inventory was completely unplayable, probably caused by my failed attempt to implement the creative mode inventory. The bug was never fixed, and the project was scrapped. I had also recently started the mod Continued Indev, which was basically the same as Continued Beta, but, well... Indev.
 
Anyways, I soon lost interest in modding and stopped as a whole until October 9, 2022, almost one year after Continued Beta was created, I decided to resume modding. This time, I entirely took out the extra blocks/items and focused on the things that would be compatible with Beta 1.7.3. I decided to try once more to implement the creative inventory into Beta, and it worked!
 
However, my "luck" never lasted for long. Right when it was about to be released in November, crippling bugs hit the mod, to the point where dying would result in your world being corrupted if you went near your death location. I decided to entirely recreate the mod in November 2022, and re-implement everything I had lost.
 
On Jan 2, 2023, the first full version of BetterBeta was released. A few days later, the Discord server was created to celebrate the trailer reaching a whopping 8000 views over the course of just 2 weeks. I consider this to be my channel's "jackpot" since I've never had success on this scale over my 2 years of having this channel.
 
All in all, it's been a blast developing this mod, and I appreciate all the support (and criticism) you have given me
