I found myself in what would be one of the darkest moments of my life at the ripe age of twenty-five. My girlfriend of five years and I split up as I was planning to propose, an F4 tornado destroyed my hometown, and I quit a successful job in advertising all in a matter of months.

Many successful people we know today found success later in life. Stan Lee started the Marvel Universe at thirty-nine, Charles Darwin wrote On the Origin of the Species at fifty, and Grandma Moses began painting at seventy-eight years old.
 
So trust that when everything seems to be falling apart, new things are coming together. But you have to be open to embrace them. Simply float the river. The point of life is not in the destination, it is in the journey. But we are led to believe that life is serious and that it must be leading us to some grand destination.

Your instinct is to try to put it all back together again as quickly as possible and exactly as it was - but that doesn't work. It's still falling apart. You feel lost, hopeless and have no idea what to do.
 
It feels like everything is stopped - frozen. Time is going by slowly. You don't know what to do... and you just want to put it back together again. The way it was wasn't so bad after all...except that it really was if you're being honest with yourself.
 
While your life may appear to be just fine, underneath it all, you know that you aren't happy. You haven't been happy for awhile but you kept doing the same thing hoping for a new result. But it doesn't work that way, you keep having the same experience instead.
 
It's not working as it is, even if it APPEARS to be. The job. The significant other. The volunteering. Your life is off and while it may seem like it's falling apart, I like to look at it as falling into something new, something better, even if you can't see that possibility right now.
 
The way that things are in your life aren't right for you anymore and the ONLY way you were going to make a change was if you had to. By everything falling apart, it forces you make the changes you've been ignoring, dreading or were unsure how to do. And know this - all is well, even if it doesn't appear to be in the moment, it is!

- It's time for you to do the inner work. Heal the things it is time to heal and refill those areas (like your chest and stomach) with positive energy. Surrender the fear of the unknown.
- Create new, supportive routines. Often you are stuck in routines just because that's what you were taught to do, but do routines that are actually SUPPORTING you.
- Get clarity. What is it you would like to do and who would you like to spend time with. Define what success actually means to you, not your family and start creating YOUR success.
- Spend time out in nature. Go for a walk, a swim, take your shoes off and connect with nature. It's amazing how quickly it shifts your energy and helps you connect with your intuition.
- Trust that EVERYTHING will work out in the best way possible. You are supported! And if you don't feel supported, hire support for this transition.

My clients come to me when everything is falling apart and they're at their breaking point. I've helped them through relationship break ups and divorces after 10 to 25 years together and have them dating again. I've worked with successful women that were stuck in hustling and being everything to everyone and making under 6 figures to making mid 6 figures and actually enjoying this life they've created.
 
Lisa uses her intuitive abilities to coach successful women at or near their breaking point to reset. It's time to find fulfillment in yourself and in your relationships. It's time to stop struggling to get through the day and thrive instead. You can have it all and love this amazing life you have created. Ready?
 
I'd never lost a job, but I'd had my share of breakups. This time, my boyfriend and I were discussing our plans for the week over brunch. I suggested bringing him dessert after one of his business dinners. He was unenthusiastic. "You know the thing about this relationship?" he said. "You think about us. I think about me." By the end of the meal, we were done, in every sense of the word, and I was back to square one in the love department.
 
I doubt the breakup itself would have been enough to shake me out of my rut, but combined with the job loss and my upcoming milestone birthday, it made me realize that I needed to change my life. "We're programmed to get on track and stay on track, as in 'I've been dating him for five years, so I've got to marry him.' We forget that it's OK to redirect ourselves," says Deborah Carr, Ph.D., a sociologist at Rutgers University at New Brunswick, New Jersey. "Often, though, we need something to push us into action." For me, that weekend when everything fell apart was it.
 
I was certainly doing my share of pausing. I'd always been tethered to a schedule; now I was free to do what I wanted. So I booked a midweek vacation to visit friends on the West Coast. I watched movies in the daytime and ate cupcakes for dinner. But after three weeks, my pause began to feel more like paralysis. (There's only so much daytime movie watching and late-night cupcake eating a girl can do.) When I thought about all the things in my life that needed fixing, I moped and felt sorry for myself. Once, when my mother asked me why I was so grumpy, I broke down in front of Dunkin Donuts. "Because I have no job!" I wailed. "And I'll never find anyone because I'm old!"
 
That I was ready to move on to the next phase was a good thing, say experts. If you wait too long to act, "your energy will subside, you'll fall back into old ways and the window of opportunity closes," Buffone warns. Living in limbo was fine for a while, but I needed to figure out what my new course would be.
 
Luckily, I have a circle of friends who not only helped me find my way, but who also responded with fresh outrage each and every time I relayed my saga. One dropped everything to have impromptu cocktails and "strategize" my next move. Another invited me to sit with her in her home office so I had company while composing my online dating profile. "This 'friend capital' gives you various angles from which to view the issue, so you can reframe it positively," says Crystal Park, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut at Storrs.
 
The only thing more effective than having friends tell you that you deserve better is believing it yourself. That inner confidence comes from understanding what your best talents and skills are, then making the most of them. "Try asking yourself, Who am I when I'm my best self?" suggests Karen Reivich, Ph.D., codirector of the University of Pennsylvania Resiliency Project. As I thought back on my various job experiences, I realized that as a magazine editor, I'd felt constantly harried, but I was also one of the few people I knew who loved my job. Banker and lawyer friends dreamed of early retirement; I felt lucky to be paid to work with talented writers. Yet I couldn't help wonder about my current career path. Where was I headed? Was this all there was? I wanted more, but I wasn't sure what "more" was.
 
Normally, I'm proudly self-reliant, but this time I called Jan Tillotson, a therapist and life and health coach in St. Augustine, Florida. Like Reivich, Tillotson recommended that I zero in on my strengths as a starting point. After taking two tests to assess my abilities and values, I learned that I'm a voracious information gatherer, meticulous, results-oriented and a planner. I'm eager to please, but I need my efforts to be recognized and reciprocated more than most. I'm not particularly extroverted or community-minded. These traits suggested that I should make a career move I'd always fantasized about: becoming a freelance writer. As an editor, I'd always been secretly jealous of writers, but I never thought I could give up the comfort of a steady paycheck and the health benefits. Now I had neither of these things. I was free to move forward without taking a risk. The proverbial window of opportunity was open.
 
At first, I felt strange working on my own. But Tillotson cheered me on, giving me hints to nix my self-defeating tendencies, such as being too eager to please. "You don't always have to give yes for an answer. If a deadline seems unreasonable, say so," she instructed. With practice, I grew more self-assured, landed assignments and relished my freedom.
 
Instead of passively waiting for a setup, I played offense: I went online and opened multiple dating accounts. I tried to be very specific about what I liked in a guy (beyond superficial traits such as hair color and height). I also made a point of accepting every invitation to get out and socialize, despite my natural shyness and general dislike of noise. Because I no longer had a strict "schoo
