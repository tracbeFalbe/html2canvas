The two error codes you mentioned do indicate a permission issue. Try running the installer as administrator as outlined in this thread: The Installer has encountered an unexpected error - Getting Started & Setup - Epic Developer Community Forums

This is most likely not an issue directly related to the launcher installer but an issue Windows Installer is having itself on your system. According to the logs, Windows Installer seems to be having issues running things out of the C:\Windows\Installer folder. This folder probably has incorrect permissions setup on your computer. A quick internet search turns up a ton of similar issues with potential solutions. Here is an example where users get past the issue by fixing the permissions settings on the C:\Windows\Installer folder: link text
 
The root cause of 2502 and 2503 errors is the MSI installation service on Windows.
Whenever you install or uninstall a program, files have to be written to a temporary folder.
If Windows is unable to write to that folder then you will get these errors.
 
But when running the installer of the last RM (v3.4.45) it runs approximately half the progression bar, and then stops, shows a couple of messages including these two error codes ( 2502 and 2503), and says it closes without being able to install RM.
 
The only problem I had was when I updated from Windows 7 my Steinberg audio interface software wouldn't install, I had to totally remove it and reinstalled a few times eventually it worked fingers crossed.
 
I can not install eM Client. I get the error codes 2502 and 2503. I have tried various common work arounds for this problem but it continues to stop the installation every time. I am in Windows 10 Pro Creator Edition. Any one have any suggestions or something that worked for them. Does anyone know if there is maybe an .exe file installer? Thanks
 
This is exactly the same i get; i deleted the complete previous emclient installation, but it makes no difference, installation fails with these two messagess, first 2503 en then 2502 message. And i try to install version 8.2 of course, the present version. Any suggestions what to do to be be able to install EMclient?

If you have any third party antivirus program installed, then try uninstalling the Antivirus software and see if the installation goes through. Refer the section **Uninstall or remove apps and programs** from the article Repair or remove programs in Windows 10
 
Thx for your response, i executed all the above, but the problem is still there. I use EMclient on 3 computers, 2 of them upgraded seamlessly to 8.2, 1 one ot them (my main computer) has the problem described, The advise you described changes things that are on the other computers as well and not causing any issue. So i think it has to do with something else. If you have any other suggestion please let me know. In addition; all 3 computers have Windows 10, are completely uptodate concerning software and have enough hardware, especially the maine one (with the problem) is quite uptostandard looking at the hardware. Alle 3 machines are configured the same and i use them all.
 
On 2 of the computers i use the same AV program (Eset) and on one of them i use Bitdefender. I did not test the installation without the AV being active, but looking at the other computer having the same there is no installattion issue.
 
These 2502 and 2503 errors are because a program needs to install using the temp folders and they do not have permission to do so. I have been doing IT for 35+ years and my son wanted to install Minecraft the Java Edition and didn't want the Windows 10 version. After all, he paid for it. This fix is easy and universal for 2502 and 2053 errors.
 

Press the Windows key on the keyboard and while holding that key down, press the letter "R"
The Run command will display
type cmd
Hold the control key + the shift key and while holding both of those keys, use the mouse to click the OK button
Answer Yes if you are prompted with a Yes/No question
 
Hello everyone
I have tried to install Node JS on Windows 10. Unfortunately the installation proces doesnt finish because of a problem with the error codes 2502 and 2503.
I have seen a couple of videos on Youtube, that apperently solve the problem by going to the temp folder in the Windows folder and changing the permissions to ful control for everyone. I am not so sure if it is the secure and the right way to resolve the problem.
I have also looked at the " documentation" for Node JS without any succes.
I hope somebody have a reliable solution.
With greetings
David
