Allen Carr's Easyway is the most successful self-help stop-smoking method of all time. It has helped millions of smokers all over the world to quit and has since been used to treat other addictions such as drinking and gambling. Allen Carr's Easyway method works by unravelling the brainwashing that leads us to desire the very thing that is harming us, meaning that we are freed from the addiction rather than merely restricting our behaviour. The Easyway method has now been applied to the problem of emotional eating.

No one wants to overeat. And certainly no one wants to overeat for years, become overweight, and end up with a high risk of diabetes or heart disease--yet two thirds of Americans do precisely that. Even though we know better, we often eat too much. Why does our behavior betray our own intentions to be lean and healthy? The problem, argues obesity and neuroscience researcher Stephan J. Guyenet, is not necessarily a lack of willpower or an incorrect understanding of what to eat.

Having a healthy relationship with your body and food needs not be difficult. Discover how to battle your insecurities by binge eating to feel more comfortable in your skin and love yourself as you are, and finally regain control of your life and your self-confidence without attempting one short-lived diet after the other.
 
*Brain over Binge* is both a memoir and a scientific account, providing a gripping personal narrative and a research-based perspective on bulimia and binge eating disorder. Kathryn traces the course of her own condition and then describes in detail her unconventional approach to recovery. In the process, she offers a much-needed alternative viewpoint on the landscape of eating disorder literature to help others in the throes of any form of out-of-control eating.
 
When you're doing something that's out of the ordinary, your mental programing, your paradigm, will try and stop you. If you want to win, you must keep going. Your paradigms may be masked in complacency, fear, worry, anxiety, insecurities, self-doubt, mental hurry, and self-loathing - the result is keeping you stuck...locked in a box and starved of your dreams and ambitions.
 
Jamie Tyrone was 49 years old when she learned she had a 91% chance of getting Alzheimer's disease - by accident through genetic testing. She was shocked, but after an initial bout with depression she decided to take action rather than concede defeat.

During the recorded interview, I asked Kathryn to **share her five steps to recovery.** She graciously did and pointed out that the steps are more like guidelines or things to consider and not meant to be done in some order. **I like to think of them as tools in your toolbox that you use as you work recovery.**
 
You want to begin to realize perhaps a **new paradigm that you HAVE thoughts, you are not your thoughts.** When you begin to recognize the useless, nasty, hurtful thoughts you have are part of that survival brain sending you signals out of habit patterns you can begin to regain your power.
 
Remember: **who you are is a higher level conscious self**, I call it your **Wise Woman**. Then you can become more aware that your survival brain will send signals, or thoughts, of self-defeating actions you can take to perpetuate your binge eating.
 
**When you are in your Wise Woman, your highest consciousness, you can detect the difference between the lower, survival human brain thoughts.** Low level survival thoughts are **always negative, self-defeating, rushed/panic-like, hurtful and all sort of negative things.** Your highest, **Wise Woman self is always in a place of love, adoration and timelessness.**
 
When you can **become the observer**, your Wise Woman, your most empowered self, you can then **observe the lower, survival brain binge thoughts for what they are. Junk.** Just stuff floating through your brain that **you DO NOT have to act upon.**
