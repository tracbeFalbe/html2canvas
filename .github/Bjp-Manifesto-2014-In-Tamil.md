A **manifesto** is a written declaration of the intentions, motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party, or government.[1][2][3][4] A manifesto usually accepts a previously published opinion or public consensus or promotes a new idea with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made. It often is political, social or artistic in nature, sometimes revolutionary, but may present an individual's life stance. Manifestos relating to religious belief are generally referred to as creeds or confessions of faith.

It is derived from the Italian word manifesto, itself derived from the Latin manifestum, meaning clear or conspicuous. Its first recorded use in English is from 1620, in Nathaniel Brent's translation of Paolo Sarpi's *History of the Council of Trent*: "To this citation he made answer by a Manifesto" (p. 102). Similarly, "They were so farre surprised with his Manifesto, that they would never suffer it to be published" (p. 103).[5]
 
Manifesto is related to manifest, which occurs in English as a noun, verb, and adjective. Of these, the adjective, which means "readily perceived by the senses," is oldest, dating to the 14th century. Both manifest and manifesto derive ultimately from the Latin noun manus ("hand") and -festus, a combining form of uncertain meaning that is also found in the Latin adjective infestus ("hostile"), an ancestor of the English infest. Something that is manifest is easy to perceive or recognize, and a manifesto is a statement in which someone makes his or her intentions or views easy for people to ascertain. Perhaps the most well-known statement of this sort is the Communist Manifesto, written in 1848 by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels to outline the platform of the Communist League.
 
This dashboard allows you to filter all observations (by country, years etc.) and select the dataset indicators you are interested in. Additionally, it provides links to download (coded) Manifestos in PDF or CSV format.

This dashboard allows you to search through the whole Manifesto Text Corpus for search terms, policy categories etc. If you are only looking for a specific document you can also use our Corpus Document Dashboard.
 
The Manifesto Corpus now also contains English translations of the electoral programmes. About 1,600,000 quasi-sentences contained in the Manifesto Corpus were translated into English with the DeepL Translator. Together with the electoral programmes, which have English as the original language, the English language edition of the Manifesto Corpus now provides users with a resource that contains about 1,600 coded electoral programmes from more than 50 countries between 1946 and 2022 in English.
 
manifestoR is our package for R. It provides access to coded election programmes from the Manifesto Corpus and to the Main Dataset. Specific functions for scaling of coded political texts are also included.
 
manifestoberta is our large language model. It allows to automatically categorize a wide range of political discourse into the categories of the manifesto project coding scheme and across various languages.
 
The API provides programmable access to coded election programmes from the Manifesto Corpus and to the Main Dataset (e.g for usage in Python). Here you can find all the available functions and their parameters, information on the access and a changelog
 
This is the current version of our coding handbook covering topics like sampling, document selection, coder training, unitising, coding, the category scheme as well as information on the training and the entry test.
 
This data would not be possible without our great team. Additionally, you are invited to also check our acknowledgements to the almost 200 people that coded elections or/and helped us in other ways in the past.
 
We invite users of the Manifesto Project Dataset and/or the Manifesto Corpus to submit abstracts for a conference on 27-28 November 2023 to be held at the University of Gttingen, Germany, co-organized by the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB). Check out the call for papers and more information on the conference website.
 
Party Facts links datasets on political parties and provides an online encyclopedia about parties and their history as recorded in social science datasets. The Manifesto Project's party codes are a core component of this project. Thus Party Facts currently provides links of manifesto parties to more than 60 other datasets.
 
The Manifesto Project Primary Documents Dataset aims at providing extended metadata for the primary documents that are used by the Manifesto Project Dataset (MPDS) to estimate political preferences of parties. It is not continuously updated and currently version 2015a.
 
The Government Declaration Dataset (GDDS) contains content analytical data from government declarations published by governments in ten West-European countries and Israel between 1945 and 1998 (the time frame is shorter for some countries).
 
Dating from the early to the mid-twentieth century, these works offered a historical framework for the ideas born out of the various manifestos from the time period. To further ground these works within the ideas that inspired them, a number of published manifestos, including texts from Futurism, Surrealism, Constructivism, and lyrical abstraction, on loan from North American art libraries, were on display as a key part of the exhibition.
 
The third section highlighted contemporary pieces from the permanent collection, spanning from the 1960s to the present day. This grouping encompassed works that provide a commentary on political movements and social change within contemporary contexts. Included among the artists on view were the Guerrilla Girls, Adrian Piper, Hurvin Anderson, Alfredo Jaar, Nam June Paik, Zoe Leonard, and Glenn Ligon.
 
Manifesto: Art x Agency was organized by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden and was made possible with major support from the initiative Wunderbar Together: The Year of German-American Friendship 2018/19.
 
These angry, youthful, and powerful texts are brought to life in a tour-de-force of acting by Academy Award-winner **Cate Blanchett**, who creates a kaleidoscopic series of different characterizations ranging from a TV anchorwoman to a corporate CEO to a homeless man. Presented simultaneously on massive screens, the 13 scenes draw on more than 50 manifestos by artists, architects, choreographers, and filmmakers at early points in their career, woven together into dramatic soliloquies that highlight specific movements or schools of thought. Connecting these famous texts to the humanity of everyday characters and actions, this highly theatrical cinematic installation makes its highly-anticipated North American premiere in an immersive reimagining that takes full advantage of the soaring Wade Thompson Drill Hall to allow viewers to experience both the intimacy of individual scenes and the cacophony of the work as a whole like never before. The resulting polyphonic plea for aesthetic change boldly recaptures the defiant spirit of its source material for a contemporary audience.
 
**ARMORY AFTER HOURS**
Join us on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings when the installation will stay open late and we set up a special bar in one of our historic period rooms for libations.
 
*Manifesto* is supported in part by Ken Kuchin and Tyler Morgan, Mimi Klein Sternlicht and by public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.

Written by Paul Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine, it marked a first attempt to put into words the ideas and feelings which led to Dark Mountain. Think of it as a flag raised so that we can find one another. A point of departure, rather than a party line. An invitation to a larger conversation that continues to take us down unexpected paths.
 
Those who witness extreme social collapse at first hand seldom describe any deep revelation about the truths of human existence. What they do mention, if asked, is their surprise at how easy it is to die.
 
What war correspondents and relief workers report is not only the fragility of the fabric, but the speed with which it can unravel. As we write this, no one can say with certainty where the unravelling of the financial and commercial fabric of our economies will end. Meanwhile, beyond the cities, unchecked industrial exploitation frays the material basis of life in many parts of the world, and pulls at the ecological systems which sustain it.
 
Once that belief begins to crumble, the collapse of a civilisation may become unstoppable. That civilisations fall, sooner or later, is
