This item will convert your USB dongle with only 1/4?inch extension. Not perfect, but as good as you can get. -2pcs-Micro-USB-Male-to-USB-Female-OTG-Adapter-Converter-For-Android-Tablet-Phone-Jun/32685227549.html?
 
*A great dongle that proves great things, do come in small packages. It manages to deliver a great range with great reliability, even to the further reaches of my house. All of this in such a small package is in my opinion, really impressive. Score: 5/5.*
 
*We tested against 6 other dongles 5 full size. The tiny little Sandberg Wifi Dongle was a star giving us a solid and consistent signal even through a number of walls. A tiny Ferrari in Wifi terms. We highly recommend it without reservation.*
 
The extending port that slid out from Toshiba did look transformers as fuck, but a USB port would be better. I already carry a mouse and a charger with my laptop. A dongle is not much more.
Also you can swing the laptop around above your head by USB -C, according to @SgtAwesomesauce \*

(Sometimes I miss old docks, basically all the ports were copper traces to the motherboard. So no waiting for USB device enumeration, all the displays worked unlike bad USB docks, and features like MAC passthrough were trivial. The old docks also let you plonk down your laptop, no sliding things or plugging in cables.).
 
Make the most out of a wireless connection with the Targus Bluetooth 4.0 Dual-Mode micro-USB Adapter. Use it to transfer files, synchronize your calendar, use your phone as a wireless modem to connect to the Internet, connect peripherals like a mouse or keyboard, print from your phone or PC to a Bluetooth printer, jam out to your favorite playlist sans wires, and much more.
 
It's tiny, it's handy, and it can give your normal USB-equipped device a micro-B connector! With the USB to Micro-B Adapter you can make a flash drive connect to your tablet, connect a keyboard to your phone in order to text with ease, attach a Bluetooth dongle to your RPi Zero, and more! Since this adapter is super small, it is very easy to transport anywhere you might need it --- making it extremely convenient to have in a pinch.
 
The product is not as pictured. It's missing the metal cladding on the back of the A side of the connector. Consequently it's 1.4mm smaller in width and .8mm smaller in thickness and while it will fit in a USB A female socket, it is too small to make a good connection or be retained with any kind of friction force. I bought two and can use neither.
 
I just started fooling around with Arduino, i bought a duemilanove and i have a pro mini coming in the mail.
Well anyway, i was wondering if anyone knew if it was safe to program the pro mini using a standalone USB-to-Serial dongle? All it does is plug into usb and give me a serial port (since iMacs don't come with serial ports -\_-)
 
Ipopped the dongle open and it has the same FT232RL chip found in the duemilanove with the addition of another chip we cant identify.
All i really know is that the mac drivers that come with the Arduino app make the dongle usable for me again
 
It should work, but there is one issue. Is your pro mini 3.3v or 5v logic level? If it is 3, there is a possibility that the dongle is 5, and that would fry your pro mini. If it is 5, it will work fine, because even if the dongle were 3, a 3.3 would still register as a logic high.
 
Second issue is that some of those 'serial dongles' output true RS-232 voltages (+12 to -12vdc) which would destroy arduino serial pins, and that might be what the second chip does, create rs-232 voltages. You must have one that has TTL serial voltage outputs, and yes check if it uses 3.3 or 5 vdc signals and don't use 5vdc signals on a 3.3 volt arduino board.
 
Before my pro comes in I'll build a little test rig using a dsub cOnnector and see what voltages really come out of it. I was originally using the USB to serial to interface with my x10 modules throughout the house.
 
at bilbo,
so do you mean hook up the pro mini to in essence piggyback off the serial lines going to the duemalinove and temporarily disable auto reset on the duemalinove so it doesn't try to load the sketch I'm intending to send to the pro?
 
Just as an aside, in my experience 3.3V Pro-Mini boards can be programmed just fine at 5V. The voltage regulator doesn't seem to mind the excess voltage applied to its output. Of course you have to be more careful if anything else is wired into the Pro-Mini's outputs.
 
Just an ordinary FTDI-cable or FTDI "basic" adapter, which applies 5V power on the output-side of the Pro-Mini's voltage regulator. For this to be ok, there must not be any power in the input-side of the regulator (the "RAW" pin).
 
In this case, it is important that the serial cable between your USB to serial adapter and your microscope is a null modem cable (Null modem - Wikipedia). Also make sure that you select the Leica DMR adapter, and that your serial port settings are correct (see: LeicaDMR - Micro-Manager). If the scope still does not respond, try the same advice I just wrote for the Zaber stage problem (Connection fails when configuring Zaber controller with Micro-manager), which would establish if there is any communication at all.
 
Does that scope have a DB9 (9 pin connector) to talk to the computer? If your computer does not have one of those, you will need a USB to serial adapter. The driver on the Leica DMI page is for newer microscopes that have a build-in USB to serial converter (which turns out to be a big pain since Leica is not providing signed drivers).
 
Hi @nicost, that makes sense. We are using a 9 pin- USB converter, and it seems to be working. The main issue is to have uManager to recognize the microscope once it is connected to the computer using the 9 pin connector.
Is there any other driver you think I could try?
 
Hi all.Finally got around to attempting to control some DMX lighting via the Soundswitch software and micro usb interface.Basically the software refuses to find the micro usb in hardware settings, whereas it shows up on my prime 4 when connected to it.Ive gone through the settings on my laptop, clicked on the soundswitch usb in devices, and it says that its driver needs updating, then cant find one, so its useless.Its a brand new Samsung i5 laptop, so id assume it could handle soundswitch?Literally i just want to autoscript a quick lightshow (all dmx fixture addresses have been set), or even just get the lights to do something, but they just remain dead.
 
I seem to have got the lights connected now via the micro usb and Soundswitch software, and have assigned a few dmx fixtures and autoscripted a couple of tracks.Am i on the understanding though, that this is now the only way to have the Prime 4 run lighting using its onboard lighting screen after pre-analyzing ALL music through Engine, and autoscripting EVERY SINGLE individual track beforehand?If so, this is ridiculous. Is there no way to just send fixture data to the Prime 4 via usb stick, and have it control the lights itself just like it manages to with Nanoleaf lighting panels?As a mobile dj, i simply dont have time to autoscript over 150gb of music tracks individually, which isnt exactly how Soundswitch has been marketed!
 
So to use this feature, how do i start off in the first place?My fixtures are uploaded to the dmx map/channels on the soundswitch software.If i get a track that i have pre-analysed in Engine and drop it in as a new project, i can autoscript. Thats about where i am currently. If i then try and save that project, the file though is empty?
 
Why then if i copy that track with SS data to a usb stick and insert it in my Prime 4 plus SS micro usb interface (connected to my lights), does nothing happen. My P4 shows the interface as connected, but NONE of my fixtures show in the lighting fixture screen, or react to anything in terms of overrides etc?

So I've had my HP Wireless Optical Comfort Mouse (XA964AA) for about 6 years now and it has never given me issues. We've been through thick and thin! A few days ago, however, I found that it completely ceased to work.
 
Now, keep in mind that the mouse will very randomly work when I plug in the dongle and switch the mouse on. Sometimes it will work for a few minutes and stop; other times it will work for a second or two and then stop. It does not work consistently, though. I've tried the following solutions...
 
I know I replaced the batteries a few weeks before, but I went ahead and put a new set of Energizers just in case (in both cases, the scroll light lit up green, indicating healthy batteries). I switched the mouse off and on multiple times, pressed the Connect button several times, and moved the USB do
