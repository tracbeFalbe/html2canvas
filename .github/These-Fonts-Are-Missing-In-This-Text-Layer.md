It means that your operating system does not have the fonts installed that were used in making those PSD files. This means that if you try and edit the text in those files, Photoshop will use the Myriad font to render the text and this will change the appearance of the file from its original look. The only solution is to make sure you have the same fonts installed or to render the type layers as pixel layers. Read through Photoshop's help files to learn more about this.

Was looking for the same functionality in Photoshop as in InDesign, where upon selecting "Replace all Missing Fonts", there would be a dialog box allowing me to choose the fonts to replace to. Instead, it just arbitrarily selects "Myriad Pro", regardless.
 
Adobe, this is so annoying! I know which fonts I want to replace my designers' ones with, we just don't have the same pro fonts on our systems, please allow me to choose them instead of doing it manually every time. The Typekit font choices are inaccurate, Myriad doesn't work for Bodoni.
 
It's kinda simple really. On the main menu choose . Open your  toolbox. Click on the layer that has as yellow triangle with the exclamation so it is highlighted. Go to your  toolbox you opened previously and choose your susbstitue font. That's it.
 
I downloaded a layered PSD file to work with, in the release notes it directed me to a download page for all of the font used, which was Futura Medium Condensed. I chcked and did not have any **Futura** fonts at all. So I downloaded and installed the font from the source provided by the provider of the PSD. I closed and reopened Photoshop and when I open the PSD file I get an error saying:

If I click OK, it substitutes Myriad Pro for this layer. Didn't I download the right font? I go into the font dropdown and see I have a font with a slightly different name "Futura-CondensedExtraBold-Th Regular"
 
Yes. The name embedded in the font itself may vary if the font is from a different provider, or a different version or variant of the font. Some fonts are available with different names, depending on their use (or limitations of the platforms on which they might be used).
 
Cant say for sure about Helvetica , but go to c:\Windows\fonts and try renaming Futura-CondensedExtraBold-Th Regular to Future CondensedExtraBold and reopening photoshop. I think you downloaded the wrong font
 
I went back to "type > resolve missing fonts", and all the fonts I need are now displayed as options. Yay! However, I go through the whole list and choose the right fonts that I need to switch to, then click "Resolve Fonts", and absolutely nothing happens.. literally. The resolve missing fonts window closes, and the missing font layers still have the yellow triangle showing.
 
Seems pretty clear to me that Adobe is forcing users down the Typekit path. There's no way to select and replace individual fonts in Photoshop anymore. They removed the functionality so that we have to use Typekit. Would love to hear from someone at Adobe that this isn't true, but something tells me it is.
 
If i instead choose REPLACE all missing fonts, it replaces them with myriad pro, no options between the step to select anything else. just auto replace based on what photoshop prefers, which i would imagine is useful .001% of the time.
 
I can't speak to exactly what's happening with Photoshop replacing fonts but I can speak to the Typekit side. Typekit can only sync fonts that are available in Typekit. Above, they mentioned Gotham, Arial, Stratum No2\*, and these fonts aren't available in Typekit's subscription library.
 
You should be able to replace fonts from Typekit if the fonts are in the library or have been purchased on your account. If you're trying to replace/sync a font is available and it's not working, please reach out to us directly: support@typekit.com and we'll look into it further.
 
I have a long-standing client and I need to carry out some updates, but since CC2018 has been installed I cannot see any fonts that are not Typekit. The font in question is Rockwell - not available on Typekit.
 
First, I'm sorry you ran into trouble here. I can confirm that Adobe apps are not blocking you from using other fonts installed on your computer. We want people to know that Typekit is an option but this is not meant to block the use of fonts outside of Typekit.
 
Now, that being said, I would like to see if we can figure out what's going on here. There is a TK filter in the font menu for most Adobe apps. This filters down to just the Typekit fonts on your system to make it easier to find recently synced fonts. If you click it again, all the fonts installed on the system will show up.
 
It's 2020, same problem here as OP. Working on a Mac Pro w/ Mojave, using Suitcase with Google Fonts. Replacing a missing font in a document with a font that already exists in the document does nothing.
 
If you open a PDF you can choose whether fonts get replaced or not. If you untick the replace checkbox, they do not get replaced and the according text keeps its missing font assigned while a substitute font is used just to display this text. If you select in an opened PDF such text which has a missing font assigned the interface shows in its panels and bars a question mark in front of the name of the missing font.
 
It isn't required to have a font installed to rasterize any font in Photoshop though, which is what I resorted to doing.

There are many other different programs which can rasterise fonts without having them installed - after all, the fonts needed to display text are embedded into the PDF itself.
 
If I open the same file in Affinity Photo, and the export it, it will save with the wrong fonts - they are still replaced on export, even with "replace fonts" not selected when opening the PDF. Even if you choose "rasterise everything" in export settings.
 
You seem to confuse / mix different ways to access a PDF. If you open a PDF in Affinity (or AI for instance) you choose this with the goal to edit its text contents. At least for font license reasons Affinity must not just use the embedded font if anybody opens a PDF without having the fonts installed.
 
If you have rasterized text in a PDF you aren't able to handle this as text, so you can not select characters with the text tool and the goal to copy them. Instead you can do a pixel selection and copy that part. Accordingly for curved text inside a PDF.
 
If you prefer rasterized PDF appearance you could export the PDF as image which will automatically result in pixels. Alternatively to export via Affinity or any PDF viewer you can simply use a screenshot of the wanted character.
 
I would guess that PhotoShop is doing the equivalent job of rasterizing a **Placed** PDF in one of the Affinity applications. Make a new Document and **File > Place...** the PDF, do not open it.
 
Affinity can rasterize, too, but doesn't do it automatically or by default, for various reasons. As mentioned before, just place the PDF instead opening it. If you then still desire rasterized PDF contents just select the layer + choose **"Rasterize"** from the menu "Layer" or this layer's right-click menu.
 
I place a PDF in the new file with "passthrough mode", as "interpret" mode replaces all the missing fonts,
then use Export function, PDF format, and in the settings choose "Embed Fonts: Text as Curves"
 
If you want to edit the file, e.g. by using **File > Open** or **File > Place** with Interpret mode, you must have the fonts installed or you must accept a font substitution. If you don't need to edit the file, you can use **File > Place** with Passthrough mode, and there would be no need to rasterize anything. (Also, I think that "rasterize" is not a correct term here. Convert to Curves would be better, but that's an output option in Affinity applications, not an input option.)
 
However I found that the font I was using in the main PDN Text font list was not being offered in either plugin. When I compared the fonts listed by the plugins and the PDN main font list I noticed other missing fonts both those listed by the plugins and PDN itself. I include a screenshot showing one small section of the PDN fonts list on the left and the equivalent Text Window plugin on the right. There are plenty of other cases these are just examples.
 
The missing fonts on each side are underlined in red. Walrus Bold and Warownia in the main list are missing from both the plugins' font list whilst Vrinda, which the plugins both display, is missing from the main PDN list.
 
Initially I thought it was a TTF /OTF thing but it isn't there are both types displayed/missing in both menu lists. Access permissions don't appear to be the cause of the problem either. Vrinda is a default hidden font, presumably because it is used by the OS system or some other 'important' program. But there are examples of similarly hidden fonts appearing in both lists and others which only display in one list but not the other like Vrinda but in the PDN font list rather than the plugins.
 
Paint.NET uses DirectWrite, and that plugin is almost certainly using GDI+. They have different typography systems, so there are going to be differences between them. DirectWrite, for instance, doesn't support bitmap fonts like Terminal. I don't know what Vrinda is, but maybe it's a bitmap font.
