When I look around me, I see people breaking-off ties with their close relatives as if nothing matters, siblings not talking to each other for days, weeks, even months at a stretch. I am a mortal and have done the same on more than one occasion. Thankfully for us, Islam comes to the rescue and explains the importance of family ties and brotherhood.

what if the person you want to unfriend has been talking behind your back for days now and you been pretending like nothing happened and all of a sudden they post this private picture that you sent to them on there facebook wall and all the boys saw it. and when i say saw it i mean they seen your from the neck up including your hair and you want to unfriend them because you dont want to be fake and smile in there face when you really dont like them. Can you unfriend them?
 
beautiful read Yousaf. It is completely surprising to see how some british (pakistani) Muslims have created big chasms in the familes, It seems ok for the Dads not to even know of their brothers, but it becomes the duty of the daughter in laws to make sure the brothers (their sons) are meeting well. mostly ego issues i suppose.
 
As I said, you need to take these very good questions to a person who has a solid grasp of quran, sunnah and fiqh. I can answer point no. 2 for you, though. When someone is a na-mehram, there is no relationship whatsoever.

Assalamoalaikum sister. You should try to rekindle your relationship with your sisters. You may not necessary have to involve them in your daily life or get too close, just stay on speaking terms with them.
 
Ramadan Kareem and I hope all is well. Let me share with you a fact of life. We all have people close to us who have hurt us at some point in life; some hurt more, some less. In every situation, Islam shows us the light as well as what we should do in such cases.
 
Make your sister understand this and once she does, she would probably be a little less dominant. Also, discuss this with your husband and make him understand how important your sister is to you. Once you establish some boundaries, things will be smoother and your relationships with both your husband and your sister will be less strained. I hope all this makes sense.
 
briefly i am in a physically and emotionally abusive marriage. i have been struggling for some time.
my parents have been aware for some time but are turning a blind eye and just tell me to try harder etc etc as if its my fault when it isnt. they are happy for me to continue living a life of hell rather than have the shame of divorce. they are so unsupportive and make things worse for me by supporting him. i literally have no-one to turn to for help and after all this lack of support i am supposed to maintain ties and do a fake act when i am so hurt angry and let down at them for failing in a basic parental duty of protecting their child??
 
The best way to deal with this situation is to slightly distance yourself from him without breaking ties altogether. Whenever you meet, meet him with respect and avoid any discussions that end up in a conflict. If he does get into one of his moods, you should just shut down completely and do not say or do anything that aggravates the situation further.
 
I have been through a similar situation recently and I can relate to your problem. One thing that I have learned in life is that you cannot stop people from talking. The best thing that you can do is to let them say what they want. Spreading lies and rumors about someone is a serious sin, and people who really matter to you will see right through those accusations. Just keep praying to Allah to give your aunt and uncle some hidaayat so that they can correct their mistakes.
 
May allah protect and help us all in our lives and teach us all right from wrong.My family have all split up when my parents passed away. My brother is a drug addict and everyone is fighting over inheritence.Not realizing we cant take money to our graves.Please pray for us, it has gone past the talking stage.
 
Assalamualaikum brother,
My husband and my own brother had a very big fallout a year ago, for which my husband forbid me to ever talk or see him again. We havent talked to each other since even though I do see him in family occasions. My husband had tried to forgive him 4-5 times before but my brother keeps repeating the same mistakes till my husband gav up. The sin wont be on him right, because technically he doesnt share the same blood as my brother? but i do. what should i do? i cant talk to my brother because my husband dislikes him.
 
My friend is having extra marital affairs , i strongly oppose this because of that me and my friend is not talking each other from last one year. He is still continuing his extra marital affairs and his family is totally unaware of this , i have to tell he had got a lovely god fearing wife and a 3 year old daughter who loves him so much. But from last one year my friend is having all type of relationship with his girl friend. i objected this and he is not talking to me
 
My elder brother (30 of age) use to go clubbing, drink, drugs and had a child with a woman outside marriage, this brother has caused the most havoc in the family by police and also resulted me being shot protecting the family. He had sold my car twice to pay off drug dealers. And he taught my other two brothers and three nephews that drug money is fast quick money and this is the life every man wants.
 
The other two;
one has had more girls friends then Henry the 8th wives. He would spend all his money buying them gifts and caused so much havoc at home. He would give every car I have ever owned to these women to drive claiming the car is his. He has never paid for a bill at home and my mum still makes his breakfast and washes his clothes. Has sold drugs and made an investment in a business and found a girl with the same ethnicity to marry.
 
One has so much jealousy for me. As I tried to keep the family together sacrificing everything I had to keep us together believing in hope and the future of us all visiting the house of God and fulfil our duty. This one would always cause fights between everyone and undo every good I did. He caused many to hurt me when I was traveling to work, uni, shopping, when every I would leave the home. He has a way of brain washing people with his mouth and claims the Quran states this and that without knowing the scripture.
 
My sister, she is the eldest and she uses the family to fulfil her desires and pretends to be a blond bimbo where my parents do everything which means commands us to help build her home and financial support. She completes with me for relatives praises as I want to get the family away from the location.
 
My mum has been brainwashed by mouthy brother and sister. Now my mother stated what did you do? You chased women, money, drugs and party. She and my father said go make your own life we can not deal with this no more. They say this after rubbing me dry, but this does not bother me as much as this because they borrowed loans under my name and left my name defaulted. My studies are all related to finance, and it tough to get standard jobs because employers state your over experienced and qualified. With this new law of no tax or anything for those who work under 21 makes things very tough.
 
If you have decided to move on, please feel free to go anywhere, but stay in touch with your parents and siblings, if only on the phone. At any point in time, if a conflict arises, just keep quiet and let the whole thing pass; adding your opinions will only add fuel to the fire.
 
I have been cut off from my son for over a year and it has affected me a lot , I went to the shariah court and it was ruled in my fav , but my ex rejected it and instead I have to go court where false allegations have been laid against me .how do I cope with. This ? It has affected my health nd ate of mind ?
 
Try explaining your situation to your husband. You cannot just cut-off ties with your family no matter how much they might have hurt you in the past. Keep in touch with him and ask your husband to forgive your brother; if we forgive someone today, we can expect Allah to forgive us on the day of judgement.
 
Alsalumualakum brother,
I have a sister that told me she doesnt want to know me, hear from me or even see me again, and after reading your article i am getting kind of bothered because i know this can go on for years.in this case do i still have to talk to her?
 
In my opinion, the worst of the people are those who find ways to break perfectly good relationships. You just have to keep the faith; Allah whall indeed find a way to show who was right and who was at fault.
 
Slaam. Thank you for this info its really helpful. But im in a dilemma. I have left my family to get married and I have a daughter now. I talk to my mum and her brother who is my uncle. When we do talk all he says is the things that r happening to my parents is a punishment. He also tells me stuff that I know would hurt them. I dont want to hear or know these stuff. What should I do if he keeps telling me stuff hat would hurt the rest of my family.? I feel like im stuck in the middle
 
I suggest you disregard what your uncle says, especially if it is something that may or may not be true. Moreover, try and tell him to keep the bad things about others hidden as Allah really likes those people.
 
I tried talking to my brother he talks bad about me talk bad to other people about me
My family and friends tried talking to him but he just hates me
Also his trying to separate me from my in laws my husband etc
What shall I do
 
Assalamualykum. I have brothers one elder than me and one younger than me. Iv been married 6 years and atleast for the last ten years my elder brother has bad arguments regul
