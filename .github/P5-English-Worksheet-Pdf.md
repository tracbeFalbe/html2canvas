Specifying a different role for each worksheet and switching roles without losing your work. You can execute specific statements in a worksheet, then switch roles before continuing your workin the same worksheet.
 
Your current interface role determines the default role for worksheets that you open, but the worksheets are not tied to the interface role. Each worksheet has its own role that can be setindependently.
 
Logging into Snowflake in another browser or tab. Any worksheet changes you made in one Snowflake instance persist to the other instance after a minute or two. You can continue working in theother browser (or tab) without re-entering your work.
 
Snowflake automatically saves worksheets as you type and persists the current state of a worksheet between user sessions. To organize your worksheets, double-click on the worksheet label in the tab(e.g. Worksheet 2) and type a new, more meaningful name for the worksheet (e.g. Sales Analysis).
 
The list of databases and other objects refreshes automatically when the worksheet context is changed. Users can also click the refresh button at the top of the object browser to view objectchanges immediately.
 
The query details and results displayed in the worksheet are only maintained for your current user session. If you log out of the web interface and log back in, the results from your previoussession are no longer displayed in the worksheet; however, you can use the History page to see queries you executed in previous sessions.

To select a text area, hold down the **[OPTION]** (Mac) or **[ALT]** (Windows) key. The cursor turns into a crosshair. Cick and drag using the mouse left button or thetouchpad.
 
We recommend that users back up complex or crucial worksheets that would be difficult to recreate. Copy and paste the contents of individual worksheets into files that you can safeguard. Backing up your worksheets prevents them from accidental deletion.
 
Worksheet metadata is stored in the Snowflake user stage, in the worksheet\_data directory. Executing the REMOVE command and removing the worksheet\_data directory deletes your own worksheets, which cannot be restored.
 
Use these electronic Figure Your Costs budgeting worksheets to calculate your direct and indirect costs. Direct costs are costs for which you will be billed by SAIC directly on the student's tuition and fees account. Indirect costs are costs for which you will need to budget, but will not be charged by SAIC.

You will need to choose from four possible living expense budgets to calculate your indirect costs. You may need to customize these indirect costs to meet your specific expected costs which may differ from the provided averages.
 
You should use the worksheet to determine your remaining costs after all available resources (scholarships, grants, loans, work-study and student, parent and/or other contributions) have been included. Use Adobe Acrobat to open PDF files and activate the calculation function.
 
For financial aid students, additional funding resources are most likely Federal Direct PLUS or private education loans if you have no other funding resources. These loans are available to financially credit-worthy borrowers. The amount for which you may be eligible is listed on your financial aid award letter and is based on the number of credit hours and an average off-campus student budget. Please note if the student is living on-campus, your eligibility could vary based on your residence hall charges. If you need assistance determining your eligibility for additional loans, please contact an SFS Advisor.
 
Payment in full or payment arrangements are due the 15th before each semester. Students may opt to pay their remaining balance after any financial aid resources, by enrolling in SAIC's deferred tuition payment plan for that term. More information on payment plans can be found here.
 
Please note that the indirect costs provided on the budgeting worksheets are estimated for an average 15 credit hour semester. You should use the worksheets in coordination with the Undergraduate Student Budget or Graduate Student Budget figures provided on the SAIC website. These budgets will provide average estimates for indirect costs that you may wish to use for calculations other than 15 credit hours.
 
Our advisors are happy to assist you throughout the financial aid and payment process. Please feel free to visit the Student Financial Services office, Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Appointments are available upon request if you are planning a visit to SAIC. Call 312.629.6600 to make an appointment.
 
I have been using xlwings in Python, but have not been able to figure out how to copy a worksheet. I want to treat a particular worksheet as a template, and copy that worksheet each time before making modifications.
 
This does go outside of the native functionality provided by xlwings. Because xlwings is a wrapper around pywin32, the .api() call allows access to those pywin32 functions that are undocumented in xlwings.
 
Also note that the 'After' command does not work within the worksheet; it will open a new workbook with the sheet copied. This shouldn't pose too big of an issue, as I believe the indexes can be reordered if needed.
 
For budget formats in the application that are attachments (instead of a web-based form), the following budget detail and narrative is a user-friendly, fillable, Microsoft Excel-based document designed to calculate totals. Additionally, the Excel workbook contains worksheets for multiple budget years that can be completed as necessary.
 
If an applicant does not have access to Microsoft Excel or experiences technical difficulties with the Excel version, then the following 508-compliant accessible Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) version can be used:
 
The environmental assessment worksheet (EAW) is a brief document designed to lay out the basic facts of a project necessary to determine if an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required for the proposed project. In addition to the legal purpose of the EAW in determining the need for an EIS, the EAW also provides permit information, informs the public about the project, and helps identify ways to protect the environment. The EAW is not meant to approve or deny a project, but instead act as a source of information to guide other approvals and permitting decisions. The EAW is completed by the responsible governmental unit (RGU) designated according to Minnesota Rules 4410.0500.
 
**Please note** that the guidance documents provided on this page are not intended to substitute for Minnesota Rules 4410. They are designed to assist in the implementation of the environmental review process. The guidance documents do not alter the rules or change their meaning; if any inconsistencies arise between these documents and the rules, the rules take precedent. Please contact EQB Staff with any questions at Env.Review@state.mn.us or 651-757-2873.
 
**Comprehensive Plan Certification Form**: Upon the filing of the certification specified in this form with the EQB chair by any city not within the Twin Cities seven-county metropolitan area, the mandatory EAW and EIS thresholds for residential projects within the city shall be increased.
 
You can use this tool to lookup the data needed to benchmark your property in Portfolio Manager. Additionally you can create a PDF with this information that you can use as a data collection worksheet.
 
Use **Worksheets** (index), where index is the worksheet index number or name, to return a single **Worksheet** object. The following example hides worksheet one in the active workbook.
 
The worksheet index number denotes the position of the worksheet on the workbook's tab bar. Worksheets(1) is the first (leftmost) worksheet in the workbook, and Worksheets(Worksheets.Count) is the last one. All worksheets are included in the index count, even if they are hidden.
 
When a worksheet is the active sheet, you can use the **ActiveSheet** property to refer to it. The following example uses the **Activate** method to activate Sheet1, sets the page orientation to landscape mode, and then prints the worksheet.
 
When you successfully add a course to this worksheet, you are automatically registered for the course and the information feeds into the Student Information System (SIS). The only exceptions are courses that require instructor permission to register and when you are on a waitlist for a full course or section. You will know that yo
