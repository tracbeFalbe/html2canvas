Their "database" is a group of files zipped in a .dat file (In the demo version the main DB is called "demoDB.dat".Simply rename the file to .zip, and extract the files. Then download the Paradox Data Editor, and open each table and use the "Export" function to export the files to CSV. I'm ssure you can take it from there
 
There is a easy way to import new songs: EasyWorship 2007 Conversion Utility v1.6Visit and download.Simply you will need to make a directory with txt files of each song of hymnal .Each txt file must have the first line equal to name of the song.I usually normalize as example to be more ordered in EasyWorship : MH XYZ name of song(MH = methodist hymn)(XYZ = number of hymn example 001 )If you sent the methodist txt to me I could send to you some examples of EWS easyworship files to import.

I've actually did some research about that, without even really using openlp. I really dislike easyworship (the name to begin with), so i ran across this tool easysearch. Have a look at -productions.co.uk/Software.htm and I think that's the tool you may want. Export to CCLI, import in openlp or whatever and there you go.However, if you mean exporting bibel texts from easyworship, I can't help you :(
 
Hello,My trial of easyworship has expired, so I can't open it. I have a series of .EWS files which contain songs - I want the songs out preferably without having to use easyworship itself (since I can't).Thanks,Sam
 
Those are EasyWorship service files. I don't know what format they use. The last time I used EasyWorship, you needed the songs in the database, so look at extracting the songs from the demoDB.dat file.
 
Not sure when this was added to Openlp, but in case anyone else is considering a switch or needs to import songs, somone(s) done very nice work on the importing functions.  Switching from Easyworship (previous church) to Openlp and the import tool imported all 900+ songs with little difficulty.Kudos.
 
Hi

The attached file has a program and a user manual that helps to export the songs from Easy Worship and then import them into OpenLP. It also allows you to use plain text files with songs in it to generate the xml files for OpenLP. Please contact me if you are having any issues using it. Thanks.
 
Hi all,

I'm new to openLP.
I'm having the same case as cowjam. Our EasyWorship 2009 has expired and now I need to import all the existing .ews files into openLP.

@jhosack
How did you import the 900+ songs from EasyWorship to OpenLP? Would you please share the procedure?

@mukeshmorar 
I'm unable to access the dropbox file above (404 error). Would you please share the user manual?

Thanks all!
