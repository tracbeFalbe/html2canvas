There are a large number of additional aircraft developed and supported in 3rd party hangars. You can find the most current information and links on our wiki page: wiki.flightgear.org/FlightGear\_hangars
 
So, I fly on FlightGear as I like the fact its free. But is it accurate enough to train to fly the real Cessna 172? Are there any better free flight sims? Please give your honest opinion and please try FlightGear before answering my question, I can't deal with people telling me their opinions when they have not tried FlightGear yet.
 
It completely comes down to what you want to train in the sim. I have used FlightGear in my beginnings of when I started my interest into aviation. I guess you are using the default C172. What you can do in this sim is learning to navigate, use the instruments (at least the ones that are modelled to work correctly) and maybe learn checklists. But that's it actually.
 
If you really want to train for a real Cessna 172 aircraft, I can highly recommend getting Prepar3D and the C172 by A2ASimulations. It's one of the best flight simulation addons in the flight sim industry at this time. A full simulation of everything from oil viscosity to water contamination of fuel. Even a real C172 walk-around is implemented (with fuel inspection, tire inspection, everything) and a full damage model. You have to treat it like in real life to not damage parts. And you can also install a GTN750, GTN650 or GNS systems in her, if you own one of that beauties in real life. Also study level of course.
 
Hi guys. I'm a developer of payware add-ons for X-Plane and have been hearing some buzz about FlightGear. One thing that caught my attention is that FlightGear is built on top of OpenSceneGraph and osgEarth, and my company's technology for volumetric clouds, skies, and 3D water effects integrates really easily into those sorts of systems. (See -soft.com/ if you're curious.)

1. FlightGear is under a GPL license, which means any add-ons that it links in must also be GPL (open source.) Payware for FG is a non-starter, unless a modified license to carve out add-ons has been discussed. Has it, to anyone's knowledge?
 
2. Hypothetically speaking - would you pay for an add-on to a free product if it were good enough? My main concern is that users of a free / open source simulator could have an allergic reaction to add-ons that are not.
 
From a users perspective, should it be possible, I would have no problem in paying for Flight Gear add-ons, and judging from what it was possible to attain in X-Plane 10 ( SkyMaxx Pro ) with your technology, I would certainly love to see it available for FG too !!!
 
The freedom will make it possible for future generations of the community to compile a 128-bit or 256-bit version of FlightGear, to use 32k x 32k textures with OpenGL 42.0, to adapt it for the operating system you will use in 20 years without starting everything from scratch, including the programming of the avionics of your favorite aircraft.
 
Actually, OSG is based on LGPL, and osgEarth should follow the same. So there's no licensing problem if FlightGear integrates those systems. However, FlightGear is licensed under GPL, and if it integrates with non-free software than it's no longer a GPL software.
 
Wrong. You can build any proprietary software to work on FlightGear. What shouldn't happen is FlightGear integrating proprietary software into it's code by default. So in this regard you're more than welcome to develop a proprietary add-on to the Sim, I even support this idea.
 
Yes. FOSS (free and open-source software) doesn't mean "free as in free beer", but in freedom of speech. It can be purchased, but it's users should have the 4 freedoms: the freedom to modify any parts of the addon they want; the freedom to see the source code; the freedom to re-distribute the program; the freedom to re-distribute their modified program.
 
I personally would. This is totally a question of personal choice, a user can be against proprietary software and yet fly with FlightGear without your addon. The name "add-on" is self explanatory and doesn't inflict on the users' choice
 
Like many organizations, the FSF is suffering financially. Operational costs have risen and revenue has not kept up, because people all over the world are going through the same challenges as we are. The FSF has an important role to play for computer users globally for years to come, and we still have a lot of work to do.
 

FlightGear Flight Simulator is a free, open-source, multi-platform, atmospheric and orbital flight simulator. Its flight dynamics engine (JSBSim) is used in a 2015 NASA benchmark to judge new simulation code to the standards of the space industry.
 
*FlightGear* is an atmospheric and orbital flight simulator used in aerospace research and industry. Its flight dynamics engine (*JSBSim*) is used in a 2015 NASA benchmark to judge new simulation code to the standards of the space industry.
 
FlightGear 2020.3 has 700+ aircraft in launcher with 1-click install and update, that can be filtered by advancement level in flight dynamics model (FDM), systems, or art. The rest are available through 3rd party hangars or from development repositories.
 
Broad overview of features as of 2020: 3d buildings & roads for entire planet based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and automatic generation, terrain-driven weather simulation, addons, multiplayer environment, orbital rendering, a flexible and open aircraft modelling system, varied networking and interfacing options, multiple display support, multiple flight dynamics engines, multiple rendering pipelines, detailed weather visualisation with ALS renderer, a powerful scripting language, and other features suited for settings in research, industry, DiY projects, and desktop simulation, combined with an open architecture. Used professionally, as well as non-professionally.
 
The *FlightGear* project has been used in a range of projects in research and industry, including by NASA for both Earth and Mars conditions (e.g. in ARES glider design for Mars[1]. It has been used as a research and development platform by various agencies and universities.
 
Other than aerospace research and development, *FlightGear* is used in aviation or aviation-adjacent industries in various ways. For example, teaching student pilots procedures or handling in a simulator saving expensive flight time - e.g. *FlightGear* is integrated into various FAA certified training simulators[2], in contrast to use in full-motion (6-DoF) research simulators like at the University of Naples[3] where FlightGear is utilised for physics not just used for visualisation/interface. Similarly, FlightGear has been used to teach air traffic controllers (ATC)[4] and allows for dedicated ATC client/instructor interfaces as well as visuals using real-life ATC tools like binoculars or cameras - teachers can alter traffic, weather, re-create traffic patterns, and so on. Different forms of instructor stations are possible for different areas of instruction. FlightGear has also been used in general education e.g. exhibits in museums[5] and all sorts of DiY projects.
 
The goal of the *FlightGear* project is to create a sophisticated and open flight simulator framework for use in research or academic environments, pilot training, as an industry engineering tool, for DIY-ers to pursue their favorite interesting flight simulation idea, and last but certainly not least as a fun, realistic, and challenging desktop flight simulator.
 
Being free software, *FlightGear* has historically received development from the science and engineering community. Many contributors have had an academic background in engineering, maths, physics, or computer-science - in addition to some involvement or interest in aviation like being pilots (hobby, professional, test pilots, or retired). This is true especially among long-term contributors, and the academic insight has shaped the project's simulation standards.[6]
 
*FlightGear* started as an online proposal in 1996 by David Murr, living in the United States. He was dissatisfied with proprietary, available, simulators citing motivations of companies not aligning with the simulators' users, and proposed a new flight simulator developed by volunteers over the Internet.[7] Development of an OpenGL based version was spearheaded by Curtis Olson starting in 1997. *FlightGear* incorporated other open-source resources, including the LaRCsim flight dynamics engine from NASA, and freely available elevation data. The first working binaries using OpenGL came out in 1997. By 1999 *FlightGear* had replaced LaRCsim with JSBSim built to the sims' needs, and in 2015 NASA used JSBSim alongside 6 other space industry standards to create a measuring stick to judge future space industry simulation code.
 
"scientific-visualisation" is not in the list (artificial-intelligence, astronomy, biology, chemistry, engineering, geography, geology, physics, scientific-visualization, psychology) of allowed values for the "Science" property.
