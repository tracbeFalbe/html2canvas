As the co-community member has provided you with all the required information above, I would like to add here by quoting that you will only get offline installer for bitdefender total security, there is no offline installer for other version of bitdefender products.
 
I know this thread is a few month old, but I don't want to start a new one for the same subject. I must say, I find it really odd that Bitdefender is not offering offline installers anymore. Why? Avira does it, for the reason above aswell as for security issues. I'm old, and in former times if you de- and reinstalled an antivirus program, we were supposed to disconnect our internet connection (or simply the cable) to avoid infections whilst the av is installed. I remember especially the Lovesan Worm in 2002/2003, which made your pc shutdown in 60 seconds if you didn't know how to avoid it. And it was rather harmless. Having a pc connected to the internet without proper protection seems to me a no-go, sorry. I (and probably a lot more senseful people) therefore would appreciate it if there would be an offline installer.
 
The installer available on the bitdefender websites are all online based. If you will dig a little deeper, the only offline installer available is for bitdefender total security and that is fine, since bitdefender total security comprises of all the features of its predecessor plus more.
 
Well as you gave an example of Avira offering an offline installer, there is another vendor Kaspersky which does not offer an offline installer and is totally limited to online installer. So it is totally dependent on the company whether to provide offline installer or online installer or both.
 
thanks for your fast answer. Does your explanation mean I can use the total security offline installer to install BD Internet Security on our pc's? That would be great. And, sorry - but that Kaspersky & Co. isn't offering an offline installer doesn't make it right, right? It's like jumping out of a plane with a disabled parachute for five minutes and only hoping, that nothing bad happens til it works. Thats at least my opinion, sorry.

I understand your concern for having a need of an offline installer. In some circumstances it may be beneficial. You are always welcomed to drop a feedback to support team at **bitsy@bitdefender.com** and they will share your feedback with the development team. At last, the decision has to be taken by the development team.
 
If I talk about avira which you initially mentioned in your post, if you will download any avira software from their respective website, it also downloads the online installer only. Also, below is the post from avira forum, where the user asked for avira offline installer and the staff has quoted that there is no offline installer and it shall not be available in the future also.
 
Not only AV vendors, but also other software vendors do not accompany their software to be downloaded from any 3rd party websites, even if they are providing the offline installer of their software. They may contain malware and you already seem to be very actively knowing about these stuffs.
