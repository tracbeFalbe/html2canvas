I was using Viber in both PC (not the windows 8 metro style app) and Mobile phone. Unfortunately I lost my phone. Still I can use the desktop version of Viber . I can see all my contacts there (Viber + non-Viber). I need to retrieve those contacts as .vcf or any other standard format which we use to store contacts.
 
You can open viber.db in C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\ViberPC\YourNumber with WordPad and somewhere in the beginning of the file you will find contacts phone numbers. Just enter them manually in your new phone and they will appear on you contacts list in Viber.

Or download command-line shell for accessing and modifying SQLite databases and copy sqlite3.exe , viber.db and data.db to C:\. Then in CMD(start -> run -> cmd.exe) position yourself on C:\ and enter sqlite3.exe viber.db
Then enter:

 
i think its something having to with an update bc i remember some days ago viber wanted to an update also my windows defender found whatever this is in everything that has to do with viber, vuber updates etc
